Baimbridge, K. G. Lewis, D. A.","conde, f. lund, j. s. jacobowitz, d. m. baimbridge, k. g. lewis, d. a.","In the cerebral cortex, local circuit neurons provide critical inhibitory control over the activity of pyramidal neurons, the major class of excitatory efferent cortical cells. The calcium-binding proteins, calretinin, calbindin, and parvalbumin, are expressed in a variety of cortical local circuit neurons. However, in the primate prefrontal cortex, relatively little is known, especially with regard to calretinin, about the specific classes or distribution of local circuit neurons that contain these calcium-binding proteins. In this study, we used immunohistochemical techniques to characterize and compare the morphological features and distribution in macaque monkey prefrontal cortex of local circuit neurons that contain each of these calcium-binding proteins. On the basis of the axonal features of the labeled neurons, and correlations with previous Golgi studies, calretinin appeared to be present in double-bouquet neurons, calbindin in neurogliaform neurons and Martinotti cells, and parvalbumin in chandelier and wide arbor (basket) neurons. Calretinin was also found in other cell populations, such as a distinctive group of large neurons in the infragranular layers, but it was not possible to assign these neurons to a known cell class. In addition, although the animals studied were adults, immunoreactivity for both calretinin and calbindin was found in Cajal-Retzius neurons of layer I. Dual labeling studies confirmed that with the exception of the Cajal-Retzius neurons, each calcium-binding protein was expressed in separate populations of prefrontal cortical neurons. Comparisons of the laminar distributions of the labeled neurons also indicated that these calcium-binding proteins were segregated into discrete neuronal populations. Calretinin-positive neurons were present in greatest density in deep layer I and layer II, calbindin-immunoreactive cells were most dense in layers II-superficial III, and parvalbumin-containing neurons were present in greatest density in the middle cortical layers. In addition, the relative density of calretinin-labeled neurons was approximately twice that of the calbindin- and parvalbumin-positive neurons. However, within each group of labeled neurons, their laminar distribution and relative density did not differ substantially across regions of the prefrontal cortex. These findings demonstrate that calretinin, calbindin, and parvalbumin are markers of separate populations of local circuit neurons in monkey prefrontal cortex, and that they may be useful tools in unraveling the intrinsic inhibitory circuitry of the primate prefrontal cortex in but normal and disease states.",primate,"83.625650, -109.300268",large_blue,1994,(Journal Article),J Comp Neurol,"Animals, Axons/immunology/metabolism/ultrastructure, Calcium-Binding Protein, Vitamin D-Dependent/immunology/metabolism, Calcium-Binding Proteins/immunology/ metabolism, Female, Immunohistochemistry, Macaca fascicularis, Macaca mulatta, Male, Nerve Tissue Proteins/immunology/metabolism, Neurons/immunology/ metabolism/ultrastructure, Parvalbumins/immunology/metabolism, Prefrontal Cortex/cytology/immunology/ metabolism, Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't, Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S., ","animals, axons/immunology/metabolism/ultrastructure, calcium-binding protein, vitamin d-dependent/immunology/metabolism, calcium-binding proteins/immunology/ metabolism, female, immunohistochemistry, macaca fascicularis, macaca mulatta, male, nerve tissue proteins/immunology/metabolism, neurons/immunology/ metabolism/ultrastructure, parvalbumins/immunology/metabolism, prefrontal cortex/cytology/immunology/ metabolism, research support, non-u.s. gov't, research support, u.s. gov't, p.h.s., ",Cortico-cortical

The area chosen for study is located between the cingulate gyrus and the ventral bank of the principal sulcus, and contains areas 9 and 46 as described by Walker (J. Comp. Neurol. 73:59-86, '40). In Golgi studies, the unique axonal features of impregnated neurons made possible the identification of thirteen separate classes of local circuit neurons. Five of these cell types, in their general characteristics, resembled classes identified in human prefrontal cortex, as well as in other cortical areas of macaque monkeys and other species. Measurements of the scale of axon arbors and dendritic fields of the Golgi-stained local circuit neurons also suggested particular spatial relationships of certain classes to the scale of intrinsic lattice connections made by the axons of pyramidal neurons in the same region. Similarities in morphology between cells described in human prefrontal cortex and neuron varieties described in this study indicate that this region of monkey prefrontal cortex may serve as a useful model for neuron populations in human prefrontal cortex.

J.","gabbott, p. l. bacon, s. j.","The companion paper (Gabbott and Bacon [1996] J. Comp. Neurol.) describes the morphology of calretinin (CR)-, parvalbumin (PV)-, calbindin (CB)-, and GABA-immunoreactive neurons, and NADPH diaphorase-reactive cells, in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC; areas 24a, 24b, 24c, 25 and 32) of the adult monkey. Since these local circuit neurons play crucial functional roles, the aim of this study was to provide supportive quantitative data defining their areal and laminar distribution in mPFC. The numerical densities of neurons (Nv, number of cells per mm3) in each area and layer were calculated stereologically. The mean total neuronal NV estimates across mPFC was 55,727 +/- 3,319 per mm3 (mean +/- S.D.; n = 3); values ranged from 50,489 +/- 8,374 per mm3 (area 24a) to 59,938 +/- 7,214 per mm3 (area 24c). Interareal differences were not significant. Cortical depth measurements and neuronal NV estimates for each area allowed the absolute number of neurons in a column of cortex under 1 mm2 of surface to be calculated; values varied between 86,457 +/- 15,063 (area 24a) and 128,464 +/- 24,050 (area 24c). Using immunolabelled Nissl-stained sections of mPFC, CR+ neurons constituted 11.2%, PV+ neurons 5.9%, and CB+ neurons 5.0% of the total neuron population. GABA+ neurons represented an overall 24.9% (23.5-27.3%) of neurons in the mPFC. Differences between areas were not significant. The cortical depth distribution histograms of CR+, PV+, CB+, and GABA+ cell populations in each area were derived and the percentage of a given cell population in each layer subsequently calculated. Peaks in the cortical depth distributions of CR+ and CB+ neurons occurred in layer 2 and upper layer 3, respectively; the peak distribution of PV+ neurons occurred between lower layer 3 and upper layer 5. The depth distribution of GABA+ cells reflected the combined distributions of CR+, PV+ and CR+ neurons. In all areas, the majority (74.4-84.0%) of the GABA cell population was located in layers 2/3. The depth distributions for each cell type were similar between areas. Diaphorase-reactive neurons accounted for 0.25% (0.2-0.32%) of all cortical neurons in mPFC and were distributed in two horizontal strata, in midlayer 3 and in mid/upper layer 6. A large population of diaphorase-reactive cells was present in the white matter. The absolute numbers of CR+, PV+, CB+ and GABA+ neurons within individual layers in a column of cortex under 1 mm2 and 50 x 50 microns of cortical surface have been derived.

The architectonic boundaries of areas containing HRP-labeled neurons were determined from matched sections stained for the visualization of cell bodies, myelin, or acetylcholinesterase. The results showed that the laminar origin of both nearby and distant corticocortical projections was correlated with the architectonic differentiation of the regions giving rise to the projecting afferent fibers. Frontally directed projections from limbic cortices, which show a rudimentary laminar organization, emanated mainly from deep layers. On the other hand, projections from increasingly more differentiated cortices arose progressively from the upper (or supragranular) layers. This pattern was observed for projections originating along the axis of architectonic differentiation of the visual, somatosensory, auditory, motor, and prefrontal cortical systems.

Both regions are characterized by structural heterogeneity, and include agranular, dysgranular and granular cortical types, denoting, respectively, the absence, incipience and presence of granular layer 4. In addition, both the prefrontal and anterior temporal cortices are composed of areas that have related though specialized functions. The pattern of cortical axonal termination was associated with both the structural type of the cortex of origin and the structure of the destination cortex.

C.","felleman, d. j. van essen, d. c.","In recent years, many new cortical areas have been identified in the macaque monkey. The number of identified connections between areas has increased even more dramatically. We report here on (1) a summary of the layout of cortical areas associated with vision and with other modalities, (2) a computerized database for storing and representing large amounts of information on connectivity patterns, and (3) the application of these data to the analysis of hierarchical organization of the cerebral cortex. Our analysis concentrates on the visual system, which includes 25 neocortical areas that are predominantly or exclusively visual in function, plus an additional 7 areas that we regard as visual-association areas on the basis of their extensive visual inputs. A total of 305 connections among these 32 visual and visual-association areas have been reported. This represents 31% of the possible number of pathways if each area were connected with all others. The actual degree of connectivity is likely to be closer to 40%. The great majority of pathways involve reciprocal connections between areas. There are also extensive connections with cortical areas outside the visual system proper, including the somatosensory cortex, as well as neocortical, transitional, and archicortical regions in the temporal and frontal lobes. In the somatosensory/motor system, there are 62 identified pathways linking 13 cortical areas, suggesting an overall connectivity of about 40%. Based on the laminar patterns of connections between areas, we propose a hierarchy of visual areas and of somatosensory/motor areas that is more comprehensive than those suggested in other recent studies. The current version of the visual hierarchy includes 10 levels of cortical processing. Altogether, it contains 14 levels if one includes the retina and lateral geniculate nucleus at the bottom as well as the entorhinal cortex and hippocampus at the top. Within this hierarchy, there are multiple, intertwined processing streams, which, at a low level, are related to the compartmental organization of areas V1 and V2 and, at a high level, are related to the distinction between processing centers in the temporal and parietal lobes. However, there are some pathways and relationships (about 10% of the total) whose descriptions do not fit cleanly into this hierarchical scheme for one reason or another.

The results of these experiments indicate that the medial pulvinar nucleus (Pul.m.) is the principal thalamic relay to the gyral surface of the caudal inferior parietal lobule (area 7a). Within the Pul.m. there are two or three disklike aggregates of neurons which project to area 7a; these disklike neuronal aggregates are oriented from dorsomedial to ventrolateral and extend over most of the rostrocaudal extent of the nucleus. Within these disks there are rodlike clusters of neurons which are elongated in the rostrocaudal dimension of the thalamus, and which project in a topographically ordered manner to area 7a. Thus, the more rostrally located neurons within the Pul.m. disks project to more rostral parts of area 7a and, conversely, the more caudally located neurons project to the caudal part of this cortical field. Similarly, the medial part of each disk projects to the lateral part of area 7a while the laterally placed neurons project to the medial part of the cortical field. In addition to its input from the Pul.m., area 7a is also reciprocally connected with the magnocellular division of the nucleus ventralis anterior, with the nuclei which abut upon the medullary capsule of the laterodorsal nucleus, and with the suprageniculate nucleus and the nucleus limitans. The cortex on the lateral bank of the intraparietal sulcus (the so-called lateral intraparietal area, LIP) projects principally to the lateral pulvinar nucleus (Pul.l) of the thalamus rather than to Pul.m. Area LIP has been found to project to the pregeniculate nucleus, the zona incerta, the anterior pretectal nucleus, and the superior colliculus. Area 7a projects to none of these structures, but it does project to the posterior pretectal nucleus. The thalamic relations of the neighboring cortical regions, such as the prelunate gyrus and area 7b, are also distinct from those of area 7a. It thus seems that the prelunate gyrus is primarily interconnected with the Pul.l., and area 7b with the oral pulvinar nucleus. Taken together these different subcortical relationships provide further evidence for the view that the caudal inferior parietal lobule is not a homogeneous cortical area, but is composed of a number of subsidiary fields. The projection from the Pul.m. to the lateral prefrontal cortex arises from disklike aggregates of neurons, similar in their orientation to the neuronal disks that project to area 7a.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",primate,"78.641087, -152.975920",large_blue,1985,(Journal Article),J Comp Neurol,"Animals, Autoradiography, Fluorescent Dyes/diagnostic use, Frontal Lobe/ anatomy & histology, Leucine/diagnostic use, Macaca fascicularis, Neural Pathways/anatomy & histology, Parietal Lobe/ anatomy & histology, Proline/diagnostic use, Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't, Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S., Superior Colliculus/anatomy & histology, Thalamic Nuclei/ anatomy & histology, ","animals, autoradiography, fluorescent dyes/diagnostic use, frontal lobe/ anatomy & histology, leucine/diagnostic use, macaca fascicularis, neural pathways/anatomy & histology, parietal lobe/ anatomy & histology, proline/diagnostic use, research support, non-u.s. gov't, research support, u.s. gov't, p.h.s., superior colliculus/anatomy & histology, thalamic nuclei/ anatomy & histology, ",Cortico-thalamo-cortical

In the present study, by using awake monkeys, the polysynaptic effects of electrical stimulation in the forelimb regions of the primary motor and primary somatosensory cortices on the activity of globus pallidus (GP) neurons, especially mediated by the subthalamic nucleus (STN), have been characterized. Cortical stimulation induced an early, short-latency excitation followed by an inhibition and a late excitation in neurons of both the external and internal segments of the GP. It also induced an early, short-latency excitation followed by a late excitation and an inhibition in STN neurons. The early excitation in STN neurons preceded that in GP neurons. Blockade of STN neuronal activity by muscimol (GABA(A) receptor agonist) injection resulted in abolishment of both the early and late excitations evoked in GP neurons by cortical stimulation. At the same time, the spontaneous discharge rate of GP neurons decreased, pauses between the groups of spikes of GP neurons became prominent, and the firing pattern became regular.

Interference with the pallido-subthalamic transmission by bicuculline (GABA(A) receptor antagonist) injection into the STN made the inhibition distinct without affecting the early excitation.

The other compartment, the 'matrix', has a high acetylcholinesterase activity, and is shown here to have a dense plexus of fibres displaying somatostatin-like immunoreactivity. The present study demonstrates the two compartments have distinct connections, using a method that concurrently reveals striatal input, output and neurochemical systems in the rat. Patches receive inputs from the prelimbic cortex (a medial frontal cortical area with direct 'limbic' inputs from the amygdala and hippocampus); they also project to the substantia nigra pars compacta (the source of the nigrostriatal dopaminergic system). Conversely, the matrix receives inputs from sensory and motor cortical areas; here it is shown to project to the substantia nigra pars reticulata (the source of the non-dopaminergic nigrothalamic and nigrotectal system).

Terminals of single CT axons that originated from both layer V and layer VI were confined within a laminar structure about 700 microm thick, suggesting the existence of laminar input organization in the VA-VL. Otherwise, the two groups of the CT axons showed contrasting features. All of the CT axons derived from layer VI gave rise to a few short collaterals to the TRN and then formed extensive arborization with numerous small, drumstick-like terminals in the VA-VL. On the other hand, the CT axons arising from layer V gave rise to collaterals whose main axons descended into the cerebral peduncle. Each collateral projected to the VA-VL or CL without projection to the TRN and formed a few small clusters of giant terminals. The two groups of CT neurons in the same cortical column had convergent rather than segregated termination in the VA-VL. However, the terminals of layer VI CT neurons were distributed diffusely and widely in the VA-VL, whereas the terminals of layer V CT neurons were much more focused and surrounded by the terminals of the former group. These contrasting features of the two types of CT projections appear to represent their different functional roles in the generation of motor commands and control of movements in the Mx.",mammal,"78.552642, -152.891982",large_blue,2001,(Journal Article),J Comp Neurol,"Animals, Biotin/ analogs & derivatives, Cats/ anatomy & histology, Cerebellum/cytology, Dextrans, Intralaminar Thalamic Nuclei/ cytology, Microinjections, Motor Cortex/ cytology, Neural Pathways, Presynaptic Terminals, Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't, Ventral Thalamic Nuclei/ cytology, ","animals, biotin/ analogs & derivatives, cats/ anatomy & histology, cerebellum/cytology, dextrans, intralaminar thalamic nuclei/ cytology, microinjections, motor cortex/ cytology, neural pathways, presynaptic terminals, research support, non-u.s. gov't, ventral thalamic nuclei/ cytology, ",Cortico-thalamo-cortical

L.","rockland, k. s. andresen, j. cowie, r. j. robinson, d. l.","The pulvinar nucleus is a major source of input to visual cortical areas, but many important facts are still unknown concerning the organization of pulvinocortical (PC) connections and their possible interactions with other connectional systems. In order to address some of these questions, we labeled PC connections by extracellular injections of biotinylated dextran amine into the lateral pulvinar of two monkeys, and analyzed 25 individual axons in several extrastriate areas by serial section reconstruction. This approach yielded four results: (1) in all extrastriate areas examined (V2, V3, V4, and middle temporal area [MT]/V5), PC axons consistently have 2-6 multiple, spatially distributed arbors; (2) in each area, there is a small number of larger caliber axons, possibly originating from a subpopulation of calbindin-positive giant projection neurons in the pulvinar; (3) as previously reported by others, most terminations in extrastriate areas are concentrated in layer 3, but they can occur in other layers (layers 4,5,6, and, occasionally, layer 1) as collaterals of a single axon; in addition, (4) the size of individual arbors and of the terminal field as a whole varies with cortical area. In areas V2 and V3, there is typically a single principal arbor (0.25-0.50 mm in diameter) and several smaller arbors. In area V4, the principal arbor is larger (2.0- to 2.5-mm-wide), but in area MT/V5, the arbors tend to be smaller (0.15 mm in diameter). Size differences might result from specializations of the target areas, or may be more related to the particular injection site and how this projects to individual cortical areas. Feedforward cortical axons, except in area V2, have multiple arbors, but these do not show any obvious size progression. Thus, in areas V2, V3, and especially V4, PC fields are larger than those of cortical axons, but in MT/V5 they are smaller. Terminal specializations of PC connections tend to be larger than those of corticocortical, but the projection foci are less dense. Further work is necessary to determine the differential interactions within and between systems, and how these might result in the complex patterns of suppression and enhancement, postulated as gating mechanisms in cortical attentional effects, or in different states of arousal.",primate,"83.564197, -129.106149",large_blue,1999,(Journal Article),J Comp Neurol,"Animals, Axons/ physiology/ultrastructure, Brain Mapping, Cerebral Cortex/ physiology/ultrastructure, Female, Image Processing, Computer-Assisted, Macaca mulatta/anatomy & histology/ physiology, Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S., Thalamic Nuclei/ physiology/ultrastructure, Visual Pathways/ physiology/ultrastructure, ","animals, axons/ physiology/ultrastructure, brain mapping, cerebral cortex/ physiology/ultrastructure, female, image processing, computer-assisted, macaca mulatta/anatomy & histology/ physiology, research support, u.s. gov't, p.h.s., thalamic nuclei/ physiology/ultrastructure, visual pathways/ physiology/ultrastructure, ",Cortico-thalamo-cortical

Some data, based on extracellular injections of Phaseolus vulgaris leucoagglutinin (PHA-L), are available for individual axons projecting from area V1 to area V2 or MT. Like geniculocortical projections, axons projecting from area V1 to area MT are readily identifiable (they typically have a bistratified termination pattern and large terminal specializations and are of large caliber), but those projecting from area V1 to V2 are more variable. To provide a broader basis for interpreting constant and variable features of axon morphology, we used high-resolution serial section reconstruction to analyze small populations of PHA-L-labeled axons projecting from area V2 to V4. Reconstruction of 20 axons suggests that this system is variable in terms of overall configuration and laminar distribution. Most terminal arbors are located at the border between layers 3 and 4, but some remain entirely within layer 3 or 4, some target preferentially the superficial layers (1, 2, and 3A), and some have collaterals in layer 5 or, rarely, layer 6. Arbor size is fairly constant among the three visual cortical projections examined so far (typically about 200 microns in diameter). In area V4, however, axons frequently have three or four separate arbors, which branch divergently (in one instance, over 2.6 mm x 3.0 mm). These features may be correlated with aspects of the particular functional organization of area V4, such as coarse topography, large receptive field size, and modularity.

M.","montaron, m. f. deniau, j. m. menetrey, a. glowinski, j. thierry, a. m.","The functional organization of the cortico-nucleus accumbens-substantia nigra pars reticulata circuit was investigated in the rat using combined anatomical and electrophysiological approaches. The nucleus accumbens neurons which project to the substantia nigra pars reticulata are located in a circumscribed region of the core immediately adjacent and extending dorsally to the anterior commissure. As shown by retrograde and anterograde transports of wheatgerm agglutinin conjugated to horseradish peroxidase, the region of the nucleus accumbens related to the substantia nigra was found to receive bilateral inputs from restricted areas of the medial and lateral prefrontal cortex, i.e., prelimbic/medial orbital and dorsal agranular insular areas. The electrical stimulation of these medial and lateral prefrontal cortical areas induced excitatory responses in nucleus accumbens neurons projecting to the dorsomedial substantia nigra pars reticulata. Interestingly, an important proportion (61%) of the nucleus accumbens-nigral cells responding to the stimulation of the lateral prefrontal cortex were also excited by the stimulation of the medial prefrontal cortex, demonstrating the existence of a convergent influence of these cortical areas on single nucleus accumbens cells. Furthermore, the present data also show that the stimulation of the medial prefrontal cortex results in a powerful inhibition of the tonic firing of the substantia nigra pars reticulata neurons. In conclusion, this study reveals the existence of a functional link between the prefrontal cortex (prelimbic/medial orbital and agranular insular areas) and the nucleus accumbens neurons which innervate the dorsomedial region of the substantia nigra pars reticulata. Since the dorsomedial region of substantia nigra pars reticulata is known to project to subfields of the mediodorsal and ventromedial thalamic nuclei related to the prefrontal cortex, the present data further demonstrate the existence of a prefrontal-nucleus accumbens-thalamo-cortical circuit involving the substantia nigra pars reticulata.",mammal,"77.257337, -126.730435",large_blue,1996,(Journal Article),Neuroscience,"Animals, Electric Stimulation, Electrophysiology, Extracellular Space/metabolism/physiology, Female, Histocytochemistry, Lysine/analogs & derivatives, Male, Neural Pathways/anatomy & histology/cytology/physiology, Neurons/physiology, Nucleus Accumbens/anatomy & histology/cytology/ physiology, Prefrontal Cortex/anatomy & histology/cytology/ physiology, Rats, Rats, Sprague-Dawley, Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't, Substantia Nigra/anatomy & histology/cytology/ physiology, Thalamus/anatomy & histology/cytology/ physiology, Wheat Germ Agglutinin-Horseradish Peroxidase Conjugate, ","animals, electric stimulation, electrophysiology, extracellular space/metabolism/physiology, female, histocytochemistry, lysine/analogs & derivatives, male, neural pathways/anatomy & histology/cytology/physiology, neurons/physiology, nucleus accumbens/anatomy & histology/cytology/ physiology, prefrontal cortex/anatomy & histology/cytology/ physiology, rats, rats, sprague-dawley, research support, non-u.s. gov't, substantia nigra/anatomy & histology/cytology/ physiology, thalamus/anatomy & histology/cytology/ physiology, wheat germ agglutinin-horseradish peroxidase conjugate, ",Cortico-basalGanglia-thalamo-cortical

Parent, A.","sato, f. lavallee, p. levesque, m. parent, a.","Axonal projections arising from the external segment of the globus pallidus (GPe) in cynomolgus monkeys (Macaca fascicularis) were mapped after labeling small pools (5-15 cells) of neurons with biotinylated dextran amine. Seventy-six single axons were reconstructed from serial sagittal sections with a camera lucida. The majority of labeled GPe cells displayed long, aspiny, and poorly branched dendrites that arborized mostly along the sagittal plane, whereas others showed dendrites radiating in all directions. Numerous GPe axons emitted short, intranuclear collaterals that arborized close to their parent cell body. Based on their axonal targets, four distinct types of GPe projection neurons have been identified: 1) neurons that project to the internal segment of the globus pallidus (GPi), the subthalamic nucleus (STN), and the substantia nigra, pars reticulata (SNr; 13.2%); 2) neurons that target the GPi and the STN (18.4%); 3) neurons that project to the STN and the SNr (52.6%); and 4) neurons that target the striatum (15.8%). Labeled GPe axons displayed large varicosities that often were closely apposed to the somata and proximal dendrites of STN, GPi, and SNr neurons. At striatal levels, however, GPe axons displayed small axonal varicosities that did not form perineuronal nets. These results suggest that the GPe is an important integrative locus in primate basal ganglia. This nucleus harbors several subtypes of projection neurons that are endowed with a highly patterned set of collaterals. This organization allows single GPe neurons to exert a multifarious effect not only on the STN, which is the claimed GPe target, but also on the two major output structures of the basal ganglia, the SNr and the GPi.",primate,"77.831647, -128.504257",large_blue,2000,(Journal Article),J Comp Neurol,"Animals, Axons/ physiology/ ultrastructure, Dendrites/ultrastructure, Female, Globus Pallidus/cytology/ physiology/ultrastructure, Image Processing, Computer-Assisted, Macaca fascicularis/ anatomy & histology/ physiology, Male, Neural Pathways/physiology/ultrastructure, Neurons/ physiology/ultrastructure, Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't, Synaptic Transmission/physiology, ","animals, axons/ physiology/ ultrastructure, dendrites/ultrastructure, female, globus pallidus/cytology/ physiology/ultrastructure, image processing, computer-assisted, macaca fascicularis/ anatomy & histology/ physiology, male, neural pathways/physiology/ultrastructure, neurons/ physiology/ultrastructure, research support, non-u.s. gov't, synaptic transmission/physiology, ",Cortico-basalGanglia-thalamo-cortical

Particular attention was paid to the topographic organization of terminal fields in the globus pallidus and substantia nigra, the projections to non-extrapyramidal areas, the relationship between projections from the nucleus accumbens and the other parts of the ventral striatum, and the comparison between ventral and dorsal striatal projections. This study demonstrates that in monkeys a circumscribed region of the globus pallidus receives topographically organized efferent fibers from the ventral striatum. The ventral striatal fibers terminate in the ventral pallidum, the subcommissural part of the globus pallidus, the rostral pole of the external segment, and the rostromedial portion of the internal segment. The more central and caudal portions of the globus pallidus do not receive this input.

Furthermore, they project throughout the rostral-caudal extent of the substantia nigra. Projections from the medial part of the ventral striatum reach the more caudally located pedunculopontine tegmental nucleus. Thus unlike the above described terminals in the globus pallidus, the ventral striatum project widely throughout the substantia nigra, a fact that indicates that they may contribute to the integration between limbic and other output systems of the striatum.

The injection sites included the tail and genu of the caudate nucleus (14 cases), the head of the caudate (1 case), and the ventral putamen (3 cases). Retrogradely labeled cells were located predominantly in layer 5 of the ipsilateral cortex but were also found in layers 3 and 6. After caudate injections, labeled cells were found both in large, nearly continuous regions of cortex topographically related to the site of the injection, and in several smaller cortical regions that were discontinuous and common to many or all of the injection sites. The continuously labeled regions included nearly all known visual cortical areas, except for the striate cortex. After injections in the rostral tail, the continuously labeled region included the rostral portion of Bonin and Bailey's (Urbana: University of Illinois Press. '47) area TE and adjacent portions of TF, TH, TG, and, occasionally, area 35 (Brodmann, Leipzig: J.A. Barth. '09). After injections into the posterior tail and ventral genu, the labeled region shifted posteriorly in TE and TF, and into TEO and the ventral parts of prestriate areas V4, V3, and (sparsely) V2. As the injection site was advanced into the dorsal genu, the labeled region shifted dorsally toward the parietal lobe, including prestriate areas MT and PO, parietal area PG (Brodmann's area 7), the ventral and lateral intraparietal sulcal areas (VIP and LIP, respectively), and area PE and adjacent area LC (Brodmann's areas 5 and 23, respectively). The discontinuous areas labeled by many different injections included the principal sulcus/frontal eye field region, the anterior cingulate cortex, and the superior temporal polysensory area. Thus, whereas temporal, occipital, and parietal visual cortical areas project into the caudate largely according to proximity, certain multimodal cortical areas seem to have a much wider projection. To determine whether visual cortical areas have additional projections to the caudate beyond the territory of our retrograde injection sites in the tail and genu. 3H-labeled amino acids were injected into areas TE, V4, and MT in three additional monkeys.

The answer to this puzzle can be found in the nature of cerebellar connections to areas of the cerebral cortex (particularly the prefrontal cortex) and in the uniformity of its intrinsic cellular organization, which implies uniformity in information processing regardless of the area of origin in the cerebral cortex. With this in mind, the relatively well-developed models of how the cerebellum processes information from the motor cortex might be extended to explain how it could also process information from the prefrontal cortex.",primate,"76.897702, -91.894181",large_blue,2006,(Journal Article),Nat Rev Neurosci,,,L1-Cortical

The tissue was processed sequentially for WGA-HRP, and then BDA immunohistochemistry using two different chromogens. Since the two labels were easily distinguishable on the same histological section, the interrelationship between the cerebellar and pallidal projection systems could be directly evaluated. We found that both the cerebellothalamic and pallidothalamic label consisted of dense plexuses of labeled fibers and swellings in a patch-like configuration. The patches or foci of labeling were distributed either as dense single label or as interdigitating patches of double label. We found dense single label in the central portion of the ventral anterior nucleus pars principalis (VApc) and the ventral lateral nucleus pars oralis (VLo) following the GPi injections or in the central portion of the ventral posterior lateral nucleus pars oralis (VPLo) and nucleus X (X) following the cerebellar nuclei injections. Complementary interdigitating patches of WGA-HRP and BDA labeling were found primarily in transitional border regions between thalamic nuclei. On occasion, we found overlap of both labels. We observed a gradient pattern in the density of the pallidothalamic and cerebellothalamic projections. The pallidothalamic territory included VApc, VLo, and the ventral lateral nucleus pars caudalis (VLc), with the density of these projections decreasing along an anterior to posterior gradient in the thalamus. Occasional patches of pallidal label were found in VPLo and nucleus X. Conversely, the density of cerebellothalamic projections increased along the same gradient, with the cerebellothalamic territory extending anteriorly beyond the cell-sparse zones of VPLo, X, and VLc to include VLo and VApc also.

Interneurons were also identified using GABA immunocytochemistry. The areal and laminar distributions of CR, PV, and CB cells were consistent across mPFC; their morphological characteristics identified them as local circuit neurons. Throughout layers 2-6: CR immunoreactivity labelled double bouquet and bipolar neurons, PV was localised in large and small basket neurons and in chandelier (axoaxonic) cells, while CB immunoreactivity was present in double bouquet, Martinotti, and neurogliaform neurons. In addition, some cells in layer 1 (including Cajal-Retzius neurons) were CR immunoreactive. Calbindin immunoreactivity also labelled a population of large nonpyramidal neurons deep in the cortex. Other types of CR, PV and CB cells were also immunolabelled. A small population of layer 3 pyramidal cells was weakly CB immunoreactive. Peak cell densities occurred in layer 2/upper layer 3 for CR+ neurons and in upper to midlayer 3 for CB+ cells. PV+ neuron density peaked in midcortex.

The calcium-binding proteins, calretinin, calbindin, and parvalbumin, are expressed in a variety of cortical local circuit neurons. However, in the primate prefrontal cortex, relatively little is known, especially with regard to calretinin, about the specific classes or distribution of local circuit neurons that contain these calcium-binding proteins. In this study, we used immunohistochemical techniques to characterize and compare the morphological features and distribution in macaque monkey prefrontal cortex of local circuit neurons that contain each of these calcium-binding proteins. On the basis of the axonal features of the labeled neurons, and correlations with previous Golgi studies, calretinin appeared to be present in double-bouquet neurons, calbindin in neurogliaform neurons and Martinotti cells, and parvalbumin in chandelier and wide arbor (basket) neurons. Calretinin was also found in other cell populations, such as a distinctive group of large neurons in the infragranular layers, but it was not possible to assign these neurons to a known cell class. In addition, although the animals studied were adults, immunoreactivity for both calretinin and calbindin was found in Cajal-Retzius neurons of layer I. Dual labeling studies confirmed that with the exception of the Cajal-Retzius neurons, each calcium-binding protein was expressed in separate populations of prefrontal cortical neurons. Comparisons of the laminar distributions of the labeled neurons also indicated that these calcium-binding proteins were segregated into discrete neuronal populations. Calretinin-positive neurons were present in greatest density in deep layer I and layer II, calbindin-immunoreactive cells were most dense in layers II-superficial III, and parvalbumin-containing neurons were present in greatest density in the middle cortical layers. In addition, the relative density of calretinin-labeled neurons was approximately twice that of the calbindin- and parvalbumin-positive neurons. However, within each group of labeled neurons, their laminar distribution and relative density did not differ substantially across regions of the prefrontal cortex. These findings demonstrate that calretinin, calbindin, and parvalbumin are markers of separate populations of local circuit neurons in monkey prefrontal cortex, and that they may be useful tools in unraveling the intrinsic inhibitory circuitry of the primate prefrontal cortex in but normal and disease states.",primate,"83.312819, -97.738846",large_blue,1994,(Journal Article),J Comp Neurol,"Animals, Axons/immunology/metabolism/ultrastructure, Calcium-Binding Protein, Vitamin D-Dependent/immunology/metabolism, Calcium-Binding Proteins/immunology/ metabolism, Female, Immunohistochemistry, Macaca fascicularis, Macaca mulatta, Male, Nerve Tissue Proteins/immunology/metabolism, Neurons/immunology/ metabolism/ultrastructure, Parvalbumins/immunology/metabolism, Prefrontal Cortex/cytology/immunology/ metabolism, Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't, Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S., ","animals, axons/immunology/metabolism/ultrastructure, calcium-binding protein, vitamin d-dependent/immunology/metabolism, calcium-binding proteins/immunology/ metabolism, female, immunohistochemistry, macaca fascicularis, macaca mulatta, male, nerve tissue proteins/immunology/metabolism, neurons/immunology/ metabolism/ultrastructure, parvalbumins/immunology/metabolism, prefrontal cortex/cytology/immunology/ metabolism, research support, non-u.s. gov't, research support, u.s. gov't, p.h.s., ",Cortico-cortical

The area chosen for study is located between the cingulate gyrus and the ventral bank of the principal sulcus, and contains areas 9 and 46 as described by Walker (J. Comp. Neurol. 73:59-86, '40). In Golgi studies, the unique axonal features of impregnated neurons made possible the identification of thirteen separate classes of local circuit neurons. Five of these cell types, in their general characteristics, resembled classes identified in human prefrontal cortex, as well as in other cortical areas of macaque monkeys and other species. Measurements of the scale of axon arbors and dendritic fields of the Golgi-stained local circuit neurons also suggested particular spatial relationships of certain classes to the scale of intrinsic lattice connections made by the axons of pyramidal neurons in the same region. Similarities in morphology between cells described in human prefrontal cortex and neuron varieties described in this study indicate that this region of monkey prefrontal cortex may serve as a useful model for neuron populations in human prefrontal cortex. Sufficient morphological detail was present in immunocytochemical studies to suggest one or more identifying biochemical characteristics for seven of the thirteen classes of local circuit neurons. The calcium binding proteins, parvalbumin, calbindin D-28K, and calretinin, were found in chandelier and wide arbor neurons, neurogliaform cells, and double bouquet neurons, respectively.

Somatostatin 28(1-12) immunoreactivity was detected in beaded axon neurons in layers 5 and 6.

In Golgi studies, the unique axonal features of impregnated neurons made possible the identification of thirteen separate classes of local circuit neurons. Five of these cell types, in their general characteristics, resembled classes identified in human prefrontal cortex, as well as in other cortical areas of macaque monkeys and other species. Measurements of the scale of axon arbors and dendritic fields of the Golgi-stained local circuit neurons also suggested particular spatial relationships of certain classes to the scale of intrinsic lattice connections made by the axons of pyramidal neurons in the same region. Similarities in morphology between cells described in human prefrontal cortex and neuron varieties described in this study indicate that this region of monkey prefrontal cortex may serve as a useful model for neuron populations in human prefrontal cortex. Sufficient morphological detail was present in immunocytochemical studies to suggest one or more identifying biochemical characteristics for seven of the thirteen classes of local circuit neurons. The calcium binding proteins, parvalbumin, calbindin D-28K, and calretinin, were found in chandelier and wide arbor neurons, neurogliaform cells, and double bouquet neurons, respectively. In addition, cholecystokinin immunoreactivity was present in medium arbor neurons and in narrow arbor cells connecting layers 2 and 4. Somatostatin 28(1-12) immunoreactivity was detected in beaded axon neurons in layers 5 and 6.

In one animal, Fast blue and Diamidino yellow were injected in F7 and F2, respectively; in a second animal, the pattern of injections was reversed. F7 and F2 receive a major callosal input from their homotopic counterpart. The heterotopic connections of F7 originate mainly from F2, with smaller contingent from pre-supplementary motor area (pre-SMA, F6), area 8 (frontal eye fields), and prefrontal cortex (area 46), while those of F2 originate from F7, with smaller contributions from ventral premotor areas (F5, F4), SMA-proper (F3), and primary motor cortex (M1). Callosal cells projecting homotopically are mostly located in layers II-III, those projecting heterotopically occupy layers II-III and V-VI. A spectral analysis was used to characterize the spatial fluctuations of the distribution of callosal neurons, in both F7 and F2, as well as in adjacent cortical areas. The results revealed two main periodic components. The first, in the domain of the low spatial frequencies, corresponds to periodicities of cell density with peak-to-peak distances of approximately 10 mm, and suggests an arrangement of callosal cells in the form of 5-mm wide bands. The second corresponds to periodicities of approximately 2 mm, and probably reflects a 1-mm columnar-like arrangement.

In this study, we sought to test the hypothesis that pyramidal neurons in monkey prefrontal cortex that furnish callosal or ipsilateral projections have distinctive dendritic morphologies. Retrogradely-labeled, Fast Blue-containing callosal and ipsilateral neurons were intracellularly filled with Lucifer Yellow, immunoconverted, and reconstructed. Quantitative measurements of the size and complexity of the dendritic arbor, including total dendritic length, horizontal extent, number of branch points, maximum branch order, and number of segments, as well as spine density, were made. In general, callosal neurons had larger and more complex dendritic arbors for both apical and basilar dendritic trees than did ipsilateral neurons. The greatest difference was in total dendritic length; the apical and basilar trees of callosal neurons were 34 and 25% longer, respectively. In addition, spine density was also significantly greater on the apical and basilar dendrites of callosal neurons. These findings could not be explained by differences in somal size or completeness of dendritic filling between callosal and ipsilateral neurons. Our observations support the hypothesis that callosal and ipsilateral neurons differ on a number of measures of dendritic size and complexity. Furthermore, these findings imply that these two subpopulations of pyramidal cells differ in the number and perhaps types of excitatory inputs that they receive.

These tracers were injected into the different regions of the ventral (limbic) striatum and the dorsal (sensorimotor) striatum. The shell region of the nucleus accumbens was defined using calbindin-D28K immunohistochemistry. Following injections into the ventral striatum, there are numerous retrogradely labeled neurons in the various regions of the primate cingulate cortex, most of which are derived from layer V. The cytoarchitectural subdivisions of cingulate cortex include the anterior cingulate cortex, areas 25, 24a-c, and 24a'-c', and the posterior cingulate cortex, areas 23a-c, 29, 30, and 31. There is a topographical organization of the projections from these different cingulate areas to the ventral and dorsal striatum. The medial ventral striatum receives input from the rostral part of the anterior cingulate cortex (areas 25 and 24a,b). The shell region of the nucleus accumbens receives fibers from areas 25, 24a,b, and 24a',b'. Projections to the central ventral striatum including the core of the nucleus accumbens are derived primarily from areas 25, 24a, 24b, and the medial part of area 24c. However, few labeled cells are detected in areas 24c and 24c'. The lateral ventral striatum receives input primarily from areas 24b, 24b' and 23b and medial portion of area 24c. The medial ventral striatum and the shell of the nucleus accumbens have a similar distribution of labeled cells, such that these regions derive their input almost entirely from the rostral anterior cingulate cortex. In contrast to the ventral striatum, the dorsal sensorimotor striatum receives projections from areas 24c, 24c' 23c and 31. These arise primarily from the lateral portion of lower bank and the fundus of the cingulate sulcus. Our results demonstrate that areas 24c, 24c' and 23c, the lateral portion of the lower bank and the fundus of the cingulate sulcus project to the dorsal sensorimotor striatum. The medial portion of the lower bank of the cingulate cortex projects to the ventral striatum including the core of the nucleus accumbens.

This cortical cholinergic innervation has been implicated in behavioral and cognitive functions, including learning and memory. Recent evidence revealed differences among primate species in the pattern of cholinergic innervation specific to the prefrontal cortex. While macaques displayed denser cholinergic innervation in layers I and II relative to layers V and VI, in chimpanzees and humans, layers V and VI were as heavily innervated as the supragranular layers. Furthermore, clusters of cholinergic axons were observed within the prefrontal cortex of both humans and chimpanzees to the exclusion of macaque monkeys, and were most commonly seen in humans. The aim of the present study was to determine whether the Ch4 cell group was modified during evolution of anthropoid primates as a possible correlate of these changes in cortical cholinergic innervation. We used stereologic methods to estimate the total number of choline acetyltransferase-immunoreactive magnocellular neurons within the nbM of New World monkeys, Old World monkeys, apes, and humans. Linear regression analyses were used to examine the relationship of the Ch4 cell group with neocortical volume and brain mass. Results showed that total nbM neuron numbers hyposcale relative to both neocortical volume and brain mass. Notably, the total number of nbM neurons in humans were included within the 95% confidence intervals for the prediction generated from nonhuman data. In conclusion, while differences in the cholinergic system exist among primate species, such changes appear to involve mostly axon collateral terminations within the neocortex and, with the exception of the relatively small group of cholinergic cells of the subputaminal subdivision of the nbM at the anterointermediate and rostrolateral levels, are not accompanied by a significant extra-allometric increase in the overall number of subcortical neurons that provide that innervation.",unknown,"79.087982, -95.086551",large_blue,2011,(Journal Article),Neuroscience,,,Cortico-pontine

C.","satoh, k. fibiger, h. c.","The morphological characteristics of cholinergic neurons in the central nervous system (CNS) of the baboon (Papio papio) were studied by choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) immunohistochemistry and acetylcholinesterase (AChE) pharmacohistochemistry. The distributions of central cholinergic neurons as visualized by these two histochemical techniques were similar in most, but not all regions of the brain and spinal cord. Based upon these observations, central cholinergic neurons that are immunoreactive to ChAT and intensely stained for AChE by the pharmacohistochemical procedure can be divided into four major groups: (1) those in the caudate nucleus, putamen, nucleus accumbens and anterior perforated substance. These ChAT-containing and AChE-intense neurons are large and multipolar, and are scattered throughout these structures. (2) The rostral cholinergic column, which consists of a continuous mass of cholinergic perikarya situated in the medial septal nucleus, nucleus of the diagonal band, and nucleus basalis (Meynert). The ChAT-immunoreactive and AChE-intense cell bodies of the nucleus basalis are a prominent feature in the basal forebrain of the baboon. The labeled neurons are large, multipolar, and hyperchromic and show a tendency to aggregate in cell clusters. These cells are distributed within the full extent of the substantia innominata, often being associated with subcortical fiber networks such as the medullary laminae of the globus pallidus. (3) The caudal cholinergic column, which consists of a continuous group of cholinergic neurons in the caudal midbrain and pontine tegmentum. The rostral component of this group of cells is the nucleus tegmenti pedunculopontinus (subnucleus compacta) and it extends caudally to include the laterodorsal tegmental nucleus. Compared to that in other species the nucleus tegmenti pedunculopontinus in the baboon appears to occupy a relatively greater volume and is composed of a greater number of cholinergic neurons. The cells of the caudal column are large and hyperchromic. (4) Nuclei of origin of somatic and visceral efferents of the cranial nerves (III, IV, V, VI, VII, IX, X, XI, XII) and spinal nerves. In addition to these major cholinergic cell groups, a small population of ChAT-positive and AChE-intense cell bodies can be observed at the floor of the fourth ventricle and in lamina VII and X of the cervical cord. The present findings indicate that although some differences exist, the overall distribution and morphological features of cholinergic cell bodies identified in the baboon brain and spinal cord are similar to those demonstrated previously in investigations of the rhesus monkey and nonprimates.",unknown,"79.267059, -94.933103",large_blue,1985,(Journal Article),Journal of Comparative Neurology,"Acetylcholinesterase/analysis, Animals, Brain Stem/cytology, Central Nervous System/ cytology, Choline O-Acetyltransferase/analysis, Cranial Nerves/cytology, Histocytochemistry, Male, Neurons/ cytology, Nucleus Accumbens/cytology, Papio/ anatomy & histology, Parasympathomimetics/ analysis, Putamen/cytology, Spinal Nerves/cytology, Substantia Innominata/cytology, Tissue Distribution, ","acetylcholinesterase/analysis, animals, brain stem/cytology, central nervous system/ cytology, choline o-acetyltransferase/analysis, cranial nerves/cytology, histocytochemistry, male, neurons/ cytology, nucleus accumbens/cytology, papio/ anatomy & histology, parasympathomimetics/ analysis, putamen/cytology, spinal nerves/cytology, substantia innominata/cytology, tissue distribution, ",Cortico-pontine

The injection sites included the tail and genu of the caudate nucleus (14 cases), the head of the caudate (1 case), and the ventral putamen (3 cases). Retrogradely labeled cells were located predominantly in layer 5 of the ipsilateral cortex but were also found in layers 3 and 6. After caudate injections, labeled cells were found both in large, nearly continuous regions of cortex topographically related to the site of the injection, and in several smaller cortical regions that were discontinuous and common to many or all of the injection sites. The continuously labeled regions included nearly all known visual cortical areas, except for the striate cortex. After injections in the rostral tail, the continuously labeled region included the rostral portion of Bonin and Bailey's (Urbana: University of Illinois Press. '47) area TE and adjacent portions of TF, TH, TG, and, occasionally, area 35 (Brodmann, Leipzig: J.A. Barth. '09). After injections into the posterior tail and ventral genu, the labeled region shifted posteriorly in TE and TF, and into TEO and the ventral parts of prestriate areas V4, V3, and (sparsely) V2. As the injection site was advanced into the dorsal genu, the labeled region shifted dorsally toward the parietal lobe, including prestriate areas MT and PO, parietal area PG (Brodmann's area 7), the ventral and lateral intraparietal sulcal areas (VIP and LIP, respectively), and area PE and adjacent area LC (Brodmann's areas 5 and 23, respectively). The discontinuous areas labeled by many different injections included the principal sulcus/frontal eye field region, the anterior cingulate cortex, and the superior temporal polysensory area. Thus, whereas temporal, occipital, and parietal visual cortical areas project into the caudate largely according to proximity, certain multimodal cortical areas seem to have a much wider projection. To determine whether visual cortical areas have additional projections to the caudate beyond the territory of our retrograde injection sites in the tail and genu. 3H-labeled amino acids were injected into areas TE, V4, and MT in three additional monkeys.

J.","haber, s. n. lynd, e. klein, c. groenewegen, h. j.","The ventral striatum is considered to be that portion of the striatum associated with the limbic system by virtue of its afferent connections from allocortical and mesolimbic areas as well as from the amygdala. The efferent projections from this striatal region in the primate were traced by using 3H amino acids and Phaseolus vulgaris-leucoagglutinin (PHA-L). Particular attention was paid to the topographic organization of terminal fields in the globus pallidus and substantia nigra, the projections to non-extrapyramidal areas, the relationship between projections from the nucleus accumbens and the other parts of the ventral striatum, and the comparison between ventral and dorsal striatal projections. This study demonstrates that in monkeys a circumscribed region of the globus pallidus receives topographically organized efferent fibers from the ventral striatum. The ventral striatal fibers terminate in the ventral pallidum, the subcommissural part of the globus pallidus, the rostral pole of the external segment, and the rostromedial portion of the internal segment. The more central and caudal portions of the globus pallidus do not receive this input. This striatal output appears to remain segregated from the dorsal striatal efferent projections to pallidal structures. Fibers from the ventral striatum projecting to the substantia nigra are not as confined to a specific region as those projecting to the globus pallidus. Although the densest terminal fields occur in the medial portion, numerous fibers also extend laterally to innervate the dorsal stratum of dopaminergic neurons of the substantia nigra and the retrorubral area. Furthermore, they project throughout the rostral-caudal extent of the substantia nigra. Projections from the medial part of the ventral striatum reach the more caudally located pedunculopontine tegmental nucleus. Thus unlike the above described terminals in the globus pallidus, the ventral striatum project widely throughout the substantia nigra, a fact that indicates that they may contribute to the integration between limbic and other output systems of the striatum. Finally, the ventral striatum projects to non-extrapyramidal regions including the bed nucleus of the stria terminals, the nucleus basalis magnocellularis, the lateral hypothalamus, and the medial thalamus.",primate,"76.427951, -124.508989",large_blue,1990,(Journal Article),J Comp Neurol,"Animals, Autoradiography/methods, Basal Ganglia/ anatomy & histology/cytology/metabolism, Efferent Pathways/ anatomy & histology/cytology/metabolism, Female, Globus Pallidus/anatomy & histology/cytology/metabolism, Leucine/administration & dosage/metabolism, Macaca mulatta/ anatomy & histology/metabolism, Microinjections/methods, Neural Pathways/ anatomy & histology/cytology/metabolism, Nucleus Accumbens/anatomy & histology/cytology/metabolism, Phytohemagglutinins/administration & dosage/metabolism, Proline/administration & dosage/metabolism, Substantia Nigra/anatomy & histology/cytology/metabolism, Tritium, ","animals, autoradiography/methods, basal ganglia/ anatomy & histology/cytology/metabolism, efferent pathways/ anatomy & histology/cytology/metabolism, female, globus pallidus/anatomy & histology/cytology/metabolism, leucine/administration & dosage/metabolism, macaca mulatta/ anatomy & histology/metabolism, microinjections/methods, neural pathways/ anatomy & histology/cytology/metabolism, nucleus accumbens/anatomy & histology/cytology/metabolism, phytohemagglutinins/administration & dosage/metabolism, proline/administration & dosage/metabolism, substantia nigra/anatomy & histology/cytology/metabolism, tritium, ",Cortico-basalGanglia-thalamo-cortical

One motive was simply to clarify what seem to be differences in terminology, where ""minicolumn"" can be used to refer to vertical rows of cells, pyramidal cell modules, or apical dendritic bundles. A second aim was to review anatomical details which over the years have tended increasingly to be overlooked. A third aim was to expand on recent results concerning the border of layers 1 and 2 as a specialized zone with its own micromodular organization. Views on columnar organization have arguably been heavily influenced by a desire for general principles; but re-examination of the complex underlying features may be both timely and worthwhile.

Whereas 50 years ago the nucleus was seen as a diffusely organized cell group closely related to the brain stem reticular formation, it can now be seen as a complex, tightly organized entity that has a significant inhibitory, modulatory action on the thalamic relay to cortex. The nucleus is under the control, on the one hand, of topographically organized afferents from the cerebral cortex and the thalamus, and on the other of more diffuse afferents from brain stem, basal forebrain, and other regions. Whereas the second group of afferents can be expected to have global actions on thalamocortical transmission, relevant for overall attentive state, the former group will have local actions, modulating transmission through the thalamus to cortex with highly specific local effects.

In the present study, WGA-HRP was injected into major subdivisions of the mediodorsal nucleus (MD) in the rhesus monkey in order to determine 1) The areal distribution of MD projections, 2) the layer(s) in which MD afferents terminate, 3) the tangential pattern of the MD axonal terminals, 4) the cells of origin of the reciprocal corticothalamic pathway, and 5) the degree of reciprocity between the corticothalamic and thalamocortical pathways in the different regions of the prefrontal cortex. As expected on the basis of retrograde degeneration and transport studies, injections centered in the magnocellular (MDmc) subnucleus of MD labeled cells and terminals in the ventral and medial prefrontal cortex. Injections involving ventral MDmc labeled the more lateral of these areas (Walker's areas 11 and 12); injections of the dorsal MDmc labeled the ventromedial regions (areas 13 and 14). In contrast, injections involving mainly the lateral, parvicellular (MDpc) moiety labeled cells and terminals in dorsolateral and dorsomedial areas (Walker's 46, 9, and 8B). Area 8A was labeled most prominently when injections included the multiform portion of MD (MDmf) and area 10 had connections with anterior portions of MD. A dorsal-ventral topography for MDpc exists with dorsal MDpc labeling dorsal and dorsomedial prefrontal areas and ventral MDpc labeling dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. Our findings with respect to MD are consistent with a nucleus-to-field organization of its thalamocortical projection system. Outside of the traditional boundaries of prefrontal cortex, lateral MD projections extended to the supplementary motor area (SMA) and the dorsal part of the anterior cingulate (AC) whereas the medial MD projection targeted the ventromedial cingulate cortex and spared SMA.

231,The organization of pyramidal cells in area 18 of the rhesus monkey,"Peters, A. Cifuentes, J. M. Sethares, C.","peters, a. cifuentes, j. m. sethares, c.","The aim of this study was to investigate the vertical organization of axons and pyramidal cells in area 18, and to compare it with that in area 17. In area 18 there are regularly spaced vertical bundles of myelinated axons that have an average center-to-center spacing of 21 microns. This arrangement of axons resembles that in area 17. Pyramidal cells in area 18 and their apical dendrites are less regularly arranged. The apical dendrites of the pyramidal cells of layer 6A aggregate with those from layer 5 pyramids to form swathes of apical dendrites that pass into layer 4. There they are joined by the apical dendrites of the small layer 4 pyramids, so that much of the neuropil of layer 4 is occupied by apical dendrites. Most of these apical dendrites form their terminal tufts in layer 3. Very few of them reach layer 1, which is dominated by the apical dendrites of layer 2/3 pyramids. Thus, there are two tiers of apical dendrites and their apical tufts, a deep one formed by the layer 4, 5 and 6 apical dendrites that terminate in layer 3, and a second one formed by the apical dendrites of layer 2/3 pyramids that terminate in layer 1. In contrast, in area 17 the apical dendrites of layer 5 pyramids form discrete clusters that have a center-to-center spacing of 23 microns. These clusters are joined by the apical dendrites of the layer 2/3 pyramids and all of these apical dendrites form their apical tufts in layer 1. Based upon the dispositions of the apical dendrites of the pyramidal cells in area 17 and 18, we speculate that the influences of, and the interactions between, the feed-forward and feed-back signals in the two areas are quite different, because in the two areas different postsynaptic targets are available to these afferents.",primate,"83.096064, -127.487417",large_blue,1997,(Journal Article),Cereb Cortex,"Animals, Antibodies, Monoclonal, Axons/enzymology/ultrastructure, Cerebral Cortex/ cytology/enzymology/ultrastructure, Dendrites/enzymology/ultrastructure, Electron Transport Complex IV/metabolism, Image Processing, Computer-Assisted, Immunohistochemistry, Macaca mulatta, Microscopy, Confocal, Microscopy, Electron, Microtubule-Associated Proteins/metabolism, Myelin Basic Proteins/metabolism, Neurofilament Proteins/metabolism, Pyramidal Cells/enzymology/ physiology/ultrastructure, Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S., ","animals, antibodies, monoclonal, axons/enzymology/ultrastructure, cerebral cortex/ cytology/enzymology/ultrastructure, dendrites/enzymology/ultrastructure, electron transport complex iv/metabolism, image processing, computer-assisted, immunohistochemistry, macaca mulatta, microscopy, confocal, microscopy, electron, microtubule-associated proteins/metabolism, myelin basic proteins/metabolism, neurofilament proteins/metabolism, pyramidal cells/enzymology/ physiology/ultrastructure, research support, u.s. gov't, p.h.s., ",Cortico-thalamo-cortical

In monkeys, this neuronal group was further subdivided by 5-HT2C receptor mRNA expression. The 5-HT2C(+)/ER81(+) neurons were located in layer 5B in most cortical areas, but they intruded layer 6 in the primary visual area (V1).

The Nurr1(+)/CTGF(+) neurons coexpressed ER81 mRNA in monkeys but not in mice. On the basis of tracer injections in 3 monkeys, we found that the Nurr1(+) neurons in layer 6A send some corticocortical, but not corticopulvinar, projections.

The location and density of the neuronal labeling in the different parts of the RT were studied in each case. Our results show that 1) after injections located in all the nuclei here studied, a consistent number of labeled neurons were found in the RT, except for the injections in the lateral habenula and the anterior thalamic nuclear complex, both of which did not label neurons in the RT. 2) Among the other thalamic nuclei here studied, the most medially situated receive less numerous RT projections than those most laterally located. 3) Injections in all the nuclei studied gave rise to a cellular labeling in the anterior sectors of the RT, except for the anterior nuclear group and the lateral habenula. The projections from the rostral pole of the RT were topographically mediolaterally organized. 4) The anterodorsal part of the pregeniculate sector of the RT projects upon the large-celled part of the lateral central nucleus and to a lesser extent upon the paracentral, centromedian, and ventromedial nuclei, the anterior part of the lateral central nucleus, and the lateral band of the mediodorsal nucleus.

The primate GPi is composed of a majority of neurons endowed with a highly collateralized axon that projects to the premotor neurons located in the ventral tier thalamic nuclei, the center-median/parafascicular thalamic complex and the brainstem pedunculopontine nucleus. These axons often follow a long and tortuous course within the GPi and then emerge either through the ansa lenticularis (AL) or the lenticular fasciculus (LF), irrespective of the location of their parent cell body in the GPi. Other pallidofugal axons exit through the medial pole of the GPi, at various distances between the AL ventrally and the LF dorsally. Virtually all pallidofugal axons course through Forel's field H, on their way to the thalamus and brainstem. They emit numerous short collaterals and boutons en passant in this sector of the subthalamic region, which stands out as a major target of GPi axons. Our results indicate that AL and LF do not form separate anatomical entities, each carrying axons originating from distinct functional pallidal territories, as commonly believed. Instead, these two fascicles form the ventral and dorsal borders of a morphological continuum that harbors a multitude of pallidofugal axons arising from all sectors of the GPi.

The distributions of central cholinergic neurons as visualized by these two histochemical techniques were similar in most, but not all regions of the brain and spinal cord. Based upon these observations, central cholinergic neurons that are immunoreactive to ChAT and intensely stained for AChE by the pharmacohistochemical procedure can be divided into four major groups: (1) those in the caudate nucleus, putamen, nucleus accumbens and anterior perforated substance. These ChAT-containing and AChE-intense neurons are large and multipolar, and are scattered throughout these structures. (2) The rostral cholinergic column, which consists of a continuous mass of cholinergic perikarya situated in the medial septal nucleus, nucleus of the diagonal band, and nucleus basalis (Meynert). The ChAT-immunoreactive and AChE-intense cell bodies of the nucleus basalis are a prominent feature in the basal forebrain of the baboon. The labeled neurons are large, multipolar, and hyperchromic and show a tendency to aggregate in cell clusters. These cells are distributed within the full extent of the substantia innominata, often being associated with subcortical fiber networks such as the medullary laminae of the globus pallidus. (3) The caudal cholinergic column, which consists of a continuous group of cholinergic neurons in the caudal midbrain and pontine tegmentum. The rostral component of this group of cells is the nucleus tegmenti pedunculopontinus (subnucleus compacta) and it extends caudally to include the laterodorsal tegmental nucleus. Compared to that in other species the nucleus tegmenti pedunculopontinus in the baboon appears to occupy a relatively greater volume and is composed of a greater number of cholinergic neurons. The cells of the caudal column are large and hyperchromic. (4) Nuclei of origin of somatic and visceral efferents of the cranial nerves (III, IV, V, VI, VII, IX, X, XI, XII) and spinal nerves.

Insights into how these seemingly disparate functions may be integrated have emerged from studies that have demonstrated that the mammalian striatum is composed of two compartments arranged as a mosaic, the patches and the matrix, which differ in their neurochemical and neuroanatomical properties. In this study, projections from prefrontal, cingulate, and motor cortical areas to the striatal compartments were examined with the Phaseolus vulgaris-leucoagglutinin (PHA-L) anterograde axonal tracer in rats. Each cortical area projects to both the patches and the matrix of the striatum; however, deep layer V and layer VI corticostriatal neurons project principally to the patches, whereas superficial layer V and layer III and II corticostriatal neurons project principally to the matrix. The relative contribution of patch and matrix corticostriatal projections varies among the cortical areas examined such that allocortical areas provide a greater number of inputs to the patches than to the matrix, whereas the reverse obtains for neocortical areas.

The thalamus regulates cortical activity through differential laminar connections, providing not only feedback, but also initiating ""feedforward"" loops, via nonreciprocal projections, that influence higher cortical areas. This study examines the organization of thalamic connections with cortex from basal ganglia relay nuclei, including ventral anterior (VA), ventral lateral (VL), and mediodorsal (MD) nuclei, in the Macaque monkey. Anterograde and bidirectional tracer injections ([3H]-amino acids, dextran conjugates of Fluorescein, Lucifer Yellow or FluoroRuby, or wheat germ agglutinin) into discrete VA/VL, MD, and frontal cortical sites demonstrate specific thalamocortical connections. VL projections target caudal motor areas (primary, supplementary, and caudal premotor areas), whereas VA projections target more rostral premotor areas (including cingulate and presupplementary motor areas) and MD projects to dorsolateral and orbital prefrontal cortices. Thalamocortical projections innervate cortical layers I and III, and to a lesser extent, layer V. In motor areas layer I projections are more extensive than those to layer III (and V). The complex laminar organization of projections from specific thalamic sites suggests differential regulation of cortical function. Injections of bidirectional tracers into thalamic and frontal cortical sites also show that in comparison to thalamocortical projections, corticothalamic projections to VA-VL and MD are more widespread. These findings demonstrate both reciprocal and nonreciprocal components to the thalamo-cortico-thalamic relay.

Although previous thalamostriatal studies emphasize projections from the intralaminar nuclei, studies in primates show a substantial projection from the ventral anterior (VA) and ventral lateral (VL) nuclei. These nuclei make up the main efferent projection from the basal ganglia to frontal cortical areas, including primary motor, supplementary, premotor, and cingulate motor areas. Functionally related motor areas of the frontal cortex and VA/VL have convergent projections to specific regions of the dorsal striatum. The distribution of VA/VL terminals within the striatum is crucial to understanding their relationship to motor cortical afferents. We placed anterograde tracer injections into discrete VA/VL thalamic areas. VA/VL thalamostriatal projections terminate in broad, rostrocaudal regions of the dorsal striatum, corresponding to regions innervated by functionally related cortical motor areas. The pars oralis division of VL projects primarily to the dorsolateral, postcommissural putamen, whereas the parvicellular VA targets more medial and rostral putamen regions, and the magnocellular division of VA targets the dorsal head of the caudate nucleus. Whereas these results demonstrate a general functional topography, specific VA/VL projections overlap extensively, suggesting that functionally distinct VA/VL projections may also converge in dorsal striatal areas. Within striatal territories, VA/VL projections terminate in a patchy, nonhomogeneous manner, indicating another level of complexity. Moreover, terminal fields contain both terminal clusters and scattered, long, unbranched fibers with many varicosities.

Both markers varied significantly and systematically across superior temporal areas. Calbindin neurons were more prevalent than PV neurons, with the highest densities found in posterior high-order auditory association cortices.

Reciprocal projection neurons were intermingled with PV neurons, and emanated mostly from the deep part of layer III and to a lesser extent from layers V-VI, in proportions matching the laminar density of inhibitory interneurons. In marked contrast, prefrontal connections in temporal polar cortex were found mostly in the deep layers, showing mismatch with the predominant upper laminar distribution of interneurons.

Using retroviral labelling in organotypic slice cultures of the embryonic human forebrain, we demonstrate the existence of two distinct lineages of neocortical GABAergic neurons. One lineage expresses Dlx1/2 and Mash1 transcription factors, represents 65% of neocortical GABAergic neurons in humans, and originates from Mash1-expressing progenitors of the neocortical ventricular and subventricular zone of the dorsal forebrain.

Expression of calcium-binding proteins and peptides could be shown in separate groups of GABA cells in layers II/III and V of the frontal cortex: (1) parvalbumin cells, (2) somatostatin cells, (3) calretinin and/or vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP) cells [partially positive for cholecystokinin (CCK)] and (4) large CCK cells (almost negative for VIP/calretinin). Combining the physiological and chemical properties of morphologically diverse nonpyramidal cells allows division into several groups, including FS basket cells containing parvalbumin, non-FS somatostatin Martinotti cells with ascending axonal arbors, and non-FS large basket cells positive for CCK. These subtypes show characteristic spatial distributions of axon collaterals and the innervation tendency of postsynaptic elements. With synchronized activity induced by cortical excitatory or inhibitory circuits, firing patterns were also found to differ. Subtype-selective occurrence of electrical coupling, finding for potassium channel Kv3.1 proteins, and cholinergic and serotonergic modulation supports our tentative classification.

M.","callaway, e. m.","The function of the cerebral cortex is dependent on the precise organization of the circuits formed by its component neurons. The connections between neurons are not random, but are specific at multiple levels of organization. For example, each cortical area connects to only a selected subset of other areas and within any given area the axonal and dendritic arbors of individual neurons arborize in precise, layer-specific patterns (for review see Felleman & Van Essen, 1991; Callaway, 1998). In each layer there are dendrites from multiple cell types including cells with somata both within and outside that layer. Anatomical studies have shown that axons arborizing in a particular cortical layer can connect selectively onto dendrites of some cell types in the layer, while avoiding the dendrites of other cell types (e.g. Freund & Gulyas, 1991; Hornung & Celio, 1992; Staiger et al., 1996). These cell type specific connections are, however, difficult to elucidate with anatomical methods, so the frequency of such specificity has remained elusive. Recent experimental methods combining intracellular recording of single neurons with focal neuronal stimulation by uncaging glutamate with light (""photostimulation"") have made the analysis of cell type specific cortical connections more tractable.

In all areas of cortex examined, the width of the terminal-free gaps is closely scaled to the average diameter of terminal patches, or width of terminal stripes. In addition, both patch and gap dimensions match the average lateral spread of the dendritic field of single pyramidal neurons in the superficial layers of the same cortical region. These architectural features of the connectional mosaics are constant despite a twofold difference in scale across cortical areas and different species. They therefore appear to be fundamental features of cortical organization. A model is offered in which local circuit inhibitory ""basket"" interneurons, activated at the same time as excitatory pyramidal neurons, could veto pyramidal neuron connections within either circular or stripe-like domains; this could lead to the formation of the pattern of lateral connections observed in this study, and provides a framework for further theoretical studies of cerebral cortex function.",primate,"83.576995, -97.879089",large_blue,1993,(Journal Article),Cereb Cortex,"Animals, Brain Mapping, Cerebral Cortex/ physiology/ultrastructure, Dendrites/ultrastructure, Frontal Lobe/physiology, Lysine/analogs & derivatives, Motor Cortex/physiology, Neural Pathways/physiology, Neurons/ultrastructure, Somatosensory Cortex/physiology, Visual Cortex/physiology, ","animals, brain mapping, cerebral cortex/ physiology/ultrastructure, dendrites/ultrastructure, frontal lobe/physiology, lysine/analogs & derivatives, motor cortex/physiology, neural pathways/physiology, neurons/ultrastructure, somatosensory cortex/physiology, visual cortex/physiology, ",Cortico-cortical

The classification of interneurons in the primate neocortex is further complicated by a less extensive database of the features of these neurons and by reported interspecies differences. Consequently, in this study we characterized 8 different morphological types of interneurons from monkey prefrontal cortex, 4 of which have not been previously classified. These interneuron types differed in their expression of molecular markers and clustered into 3 different electrophysiological classes. The first class consisted of fast-spiking parvalbumin-positive chandelier and linear arbor cells. The second class comprised 5 different morphological types of continuous-adapting calretinin- or calbindin-positive interneurons that had the lowest level of firing threshold. However, 2 of these morphological types had short spike duration, which is not typical for rodent adapting cells. Neurogliaform cells (NGFCs), which coexpressed calbindin and neuropeptide Y, formed the third class, characterized by strong initial adaptation. They did not exhibit the delayed spikes seen in rodent NGFCs.

A.","conde, f. lund, j. s. jacobowitz, d. m. baimbridge, k. g. lewis, d. a.","In the cerebral cortex, local circuit neurons provide critical inhibitory control over the activity of pyramidal neurons, the major class of excitatory efferent cortical cells. The calcium-binding proteins, calretinin, calbindin, and parvalbumin, are expressed in a variety of cortical local circuit neurons. However, in the primate prefrontal cortex, relatively little is known, especially with regard to calretinin, about the specific classes or distribution of local circuit neurons that contain these calcium-binding proteins. In this study, we used immunohistochemical techniques to characterize and compare the morphological features and distribution in macaque monkey prefrontal cortex of local circuit neurons that contain each of these calcium-binding proteins. On the basis of the axonal features of the labeled neurons, and correlations with previous Golgi studies, calretinin appeared to be present in double-bouquet neurons, calbindin in neurogliaform neurons and Martinotti cells, and parvalbumin in chandelier and wide arbor (basket) neurons. Calretinin was also found in other cell populations, such as a distinctive group of large neurons in the infragranular layers, but it was not possible to assign these neurons to a known cell class. In addition, although the animals studied were adults, immunoreactivity for both calretinin and calbindin was found in Cajal-Retzius neurons of layer I. Dual labeling studies confirmed that with the exception of the Cajal-Retzius neurons, each calcium-binding protein was expressed in separate populations of prefrontal cortical neurons. Comparisons of the laminar distributions of the labeled neurons also indicated that these calcium-binding proteins were segregated into discrete neuronal populations. Calretinin-positive neurons were present in greatest density in deep layer I and layer II, calbindin-immunoreactive cells were most dense in layers II-superficial III, and parvalbumin-containing neurons were present in greatest density in the middle cortical layers. In addition, the relative density of calretinin-labeled neurons was approximately twice that of the calbindin- and parvalbumin-positive neurons. However, within each group of labeled neurons, their laminar distribution and relative density did not differ substantially across regions of the prefrontal cortex. These findings demonstrate that calretinin, calbindin, and parvalbumin are markers of separate populations of local circuit neurons in monkey prefrontal cortex, and that they may be useful tools in unraveling the intrinsic inhibitory circuitry of the primate prefrontal cortex in but normal and disease states.",primate,"83.870205, -123.908169",large_blue,1994,(Journal Article),J Comp Neurol,"Animals, Axons/immunology/metabolism/ultrastructure, Calcium-Binding Protein, Vitamin D-Dependent/immunology/metabolism, Calcium-Binding Proteins/immunology/ metabolism, Female, Immunohistochemistry, Macaca fascicularis, Macaca mulatta, Male, Nerve Tissue Proteins/immunology/metabolism, Neurons/immunology/ metabolism/ultrastructure, Parvalbumins/immunology/metabolism, Prefrontal Cortex/cytology/immunology/ metabolism, Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't, Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S., ","animals, axons/immunology/metabolism/ultrastructure, calcium-binding protein, vitamin d-dependent/immunology/metabolism, calcium-binding proteins/immunology/ metabolism, female, immunohistochemistry, macaca fascicularis, macaca mulatta, male, nerve tissue proteins/immunology/metabolism, neurons/immunology/ metabolism/ultrastructure, parvalbumins/immunology/metabolism, prefrontal cortex/cytology/immunology/ metabolism, research support, non-u.s. gov't, research support, u.s. gov't, p.h.s., ",Cortico-cortical

The current study examined the raw, and size-normalized, laminar thicknesses in three cortical regions (somatosensory, motor, and premotor) of fourteen species from three orders of mammals: primates, carnivores, and rodents. The proportional size of the pyramidal cell layers (supra- and infragranular) varied between orders but was similar within orders despite wide variance in absolute cortical thickness. Further, supragranular layer thickness was largest in primates (46 +/- 3 percent), followed by carnivores (36 +/- 3 percent), and then rodents (19 +/- 4 percent), suggesting a distinct difference in the proportion of cortex devoted to corticocortical connectivity across these orders. Although measures of supragranular layer thickness are highly correlated with measures of overall brain size, such associations are not present when independent contrasts are used to control for phylogenetic inertia. Interestingly, neurogenesis time span remains strongly associated with supragranular layer thickness despite size normalization and controlling for phylogenetic inertia. Such layering differences between orders, and similarities amongst species within an order, suggest that supragranular layer expansion may have occurred early in mammalian evolution and may be related to ontogenetic variables such as neurogenesis time span rather than measures of overall size.",unknown,"82.811669, -179.080927",large_blue,2005,(Journal Article),Brain Res,"Animals, Brain Mapping, Carnivora/ anatomy & histology, Cerebral Cortex/ cytology, Comparative Study, Humans, Primates, Rodentia, Species Specificity, ","animals, brain mapping, carnivora/ anatomy & histology, cerebral cortex/ cytology, comparative study, humans, primates, rodentia, species specificity, ",Cortico-cortical

A second aim was to review anatomical details which over the years have tended increasingly to be overlooked. A third aim was to expand on recent results concerning the border of layers 1 and 2 as a specialized zone with its own micromodular organization. Views on columnar organization have arguably been heavily influenced by a desire for general principles; but re-examination of the complex underlying features may be both timely and worthwhile.

Experiments using the retrograde, horseradish peroxidase method confirm the observations of Kievet and Kuypers ('75) that the basal nucleus and substantia innominata project directly, heavily and with a somewhat crude topography upon the neocortex. Experiments involving the anterograde, autoradiographic method show that the basal nucleus and substantia innominata form part of a complex pathway that links them together with the lateral hypothalamus, certain parts of the amygdala and the peripeduncular nucleus of the midbrain. The peripeduncular nucleus is often regarded as a part of the central auditory pathway; it gives rise to a fiber bundle of considerable size that ascends on the dorsal surface of the ipsilateral optic tract and terminates ultimately in the lateral hypothalamic area of both sides. As well as distributing fibers to the basal nucleus, substantia innominata and lateral hypothalamus, this pathway provides a heavy projection to a cytoarchitectonically distinct posterior part of the lateral nucleus of the amygdala, the medial and intercalated nuclei of the amygdala and a less dense projection to the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis. Certain parts of the hypothalamus and possibly the preoptic areas give rise to a complementary descending pathway that distributes fibers to the ipsilateral basal nucleus, substantia innominata and amygdala, and ends in the peripeduncular nuclei of both sides. Decussating fibers in both the ascending and descending pathways cross in the ventral supraoptic commissure. It is concluded that the basal nucleus should include most of the aggregated and unaggregated large cells that lie in the substantia innominata and which in places intrude upon the preoptic regions and the nucleus of the diagnonal band of Broca.

Their input is dependent on the extrastriate cortical areas they target. The local feedback connections from deep layers (5 and 6) arise from a diverse population of pyramidal neurons.

F.","molnar, z. cheung, a. f.","The nature of cerebral cortical circuitry has been increasingly clarified by markers for the identification of precise cell types with specific morphology, connectivity and distinct physiological properties. Molecular markers are not only helpful in dissecting cortical circuitry, but also give insight into the mechanisms of cortical neuronal specification and differentiation. The two principal neuronal types of the cerebral cortex are the pyramidal and GABAergic cells. Pyramidal cells are excitatory and project to distant targets, while GABAergic neurons are mostly inhibitory non-pyramidal interneurons. Reliable markers for specific subtypes of interneurons are available and have been employed in the classification and functional analysis of cortical circuitry. Until recently, cortical pyramidal neurons have been considered a homogeneous class of cells. This concept is now changing as the powerful tools of molecular biology and genetics identify molecular tags for subtypes of pyramidal cells such as: Otx-1 [Frantz, G.D., Bohner, A.P., Akers, R.M., McConnell, S.K., 1994.

In contrast with previous studies of other V1 neurons, layer 5 neurons received significant input from nearly all of the cortical layers, suggesting individual layer 5 cells integrate information from a broad range of input sources. Nevertheless relative strengths of laminar inputs varied across neurons. Cluster analysis of relative strength of laminar inputs to individual layer 5 neurons revealed four discrete clusters representing recurring input patterns; each cluster included both excitatory and inhibitory neurons. Twenty-five of 40 layer 5 neurons fell into two clusters, both characterized by very strong input from superficial layers. These input patterns are consistent with layer 5 neurons providing feedback to superficial layers. The remaining 15 neurons received stronger input from deep layers.

Orthodromic responses were recorded in PTNs and in other pyramidal neurones when antidromic volleys were set up by stimulation of the peduncles or pyramids. The neurones were then labelled by intracellular ionophoresis of horseradish peroxidase and their morphology examined. All neurones studied were identified as pyramidal cells according to their morphology. 2. Six pyramidal neurones located in lamina V were well stained; they included two fast PTNs and two slow PTNs. The morphology of all pyramidal neurones in this lamina (fast PTNs, slow PTNs and those pyramidal cells that were not antidromically characterized) was essentially similar. A single apical dendrite branched as it ascended and its terminals arborized subpially. Numerous lateral and oblique dendrites branched from the apical dendrites in lamina V and near its border with lamina III: short basal dendrites arborized in the vicinity of the soma in lamina V. Long basal dendrites had a wider field of arborization in lamina V and sometimes extended into lamina VI. 3. Three to five collaterals arose from the axon of lamina V cells in the cortex and arborized in laminae V and VI. Short collateral branches arborized in the vicinity of the soma in the region of the basal and lateral dendrites. Long collateral branches could be traced over long distances (often more than 1 mm). One pyramidal neurone in this lamina (a fast PTN) lacked short collateral branches from the axon. 4. Four pyramidal neurones in lamina III were stained well. The dendritic morphology of all these neurones was similar. Apical dendrites branched as they ascended and terminated subpially. Lateral and basal dendrites formed a column of dendritic branches around the soma. No long basal dendrites were seen. 5. The number and arborization of intracortical collaterals from the axon of lamina III cells varied widely; from three to twelve collaterals arose from the axon.

Based on their coexpression profiles, we were able to distinguish several subpopulations of deep layer neurons. One group was characterized by the expression of ER81 and the lack of Nurr1 mRNAs and mainly localized to layer 5. In monkeys, this neuronal group was further subdivided by 5-HT2C receptor mRNA expression. The 5-HT2C(+)/ER81(+) neurons were located in layer 5B in most cortical areas, but they intruded layer 6 in the primary visual area (V1). Another group of neurons, in monkey layer 6, was characterized by Nurr1 mRNA expression and was further subdivided as Nurr1(+)/connective tissue growth factor (CTGF)(-) and Nurr1(+)/CTGF(+) neurons in layers 6A and 6B, respectively. The Nurr1(+)/CTGF(+) neurons coexpressed ER81 mRNA in monkeys but not in mice. On the basis of tracer injections in 3 monkeys, we found that the Nurr1(+) neurons in layer 6A send some corticocortical, but not corticopulvinar, projections. Although the Nurr1(+)/CTGF(-) neurons were restricted to lateral regions in the mouse cortex, they were present throughout the monkey cortex. Thus, an architectonic heterogeneity across areas and species was revealed for the neuronal subpopulations with distinct gene expression profiles.",primate,"82.470756, -106.195824",large_blue,2006,(Journal Article),Cereb Cortex,,,Cortico-pontine

Current models of auditory cortical organization in primates describe a centrally located core region containing two or three subdivisions including the primary auditory area (AI), a surrounding belt of cortex with perhaps seven divisions, and a lateral parabelt region comprised of at least two fields. In monkeys the core region can be identified on the basis of specific anatomical and physiological features. In this study, the core was identified from serial sets of adjacent sections processed for cytoarchitecture, myeloarchitecture, acetylcholinesterase, and cytochrome oxidase. Qualitative and quantitative criteria were used to identify the borders of the core region in individual sections. Serial reconstructions of each brain were made showing the location of the core with respect to gross anatomical landmarks. The position of the core with respect to major sulci and gyri in the superior temporal region varied most in the chimpanzee and human specimens.

Experiments using the retrograde, horseradish peroxidase method confirm the observations of Kievet and Kuypers ('75) that the basal nucleus and substantia innominata project directly, heavily and with a somewhat crude topography upon the neocortex. Experiments involving the anterograde, autoradiographic method show that the basal nucleus and substantia innominata form part of a complex pathway that links them together with the lateral hypothalamus, certain parts of the amygdala and the peripeduncular nucleus of the midbrain. The peripeduncular nucleus is often regarded as a part of the central auditory pathway; it gives rise to a fiber bundle of considerable size that ascends on the dorsal surface of the ipsilateral optic tract and terminates ultimately in the lateral hypothalamic area of both sides. As well as distributing fibers to the basal nucleus, substantia innominata and lateral hypothalamus, this pathway provides a heavy projection to a cytoarchitectonically distinct posterior part of the lateral nucleus of the amygdala, the medial and intercalated nuclei of the amygdala and a less dense projection to the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis. Certain parts of the hypothalamus and possibly the preoptic areas give rise to a complementary descending pathway that distributes fibers to the ipsilateral basal nucleus, substantia innominata and amygdala, and ends in the peripeduncular nuclei of both sides. Decussating fibers in both the ascending and descending pathways cross in the ventral supraoptic commissure. It is concluded that the basal nucleus should include most of the aggregated and unaggregated large cells that lie in the substantia innominata and which in places intrude upon the preoptic regions and the nucleus of the diagnonal band of Broca.

The time-course and sensitivity of excitatory postsynaptic potentials to current injected at the soma, and locations of close appositions between presynaptic axons and postsynaptic dendrites, indicated that the majority of contributory synapses were located in layer V. Within a ""column"" of tissue, radius < or = 250 microm, the probability that a randomly selected layer III pyramid innervated a layer V pyramid was 1 in 4 if the target cell was a burst firing pyramid with an apical dendritic tuft in layers II/I. If, however, the potential target was a regular spiking pyramid, the probability of connectivity was only 1 in 40, and none of the 13 anatomically identified postsynaptic layer V targets had a slender apical dendrite terminating in layers IV/III. Morphological reconstructions indicated that layer III pyramids select target layer V cells whose apical dendrites pass within 50-100 microm of the soma of the presynaptic pyramid in layer III and which have overlapping apical dendritic tufts in the superficial layers. The probability that a layer V cell would innervate a layer III pyramid lying within 250 microm of its apical dendrite was much lower (one in 58). Both presynaptic layer III pyramids and their large postsynaptic layer V targets could therefore access similar inputs in layers I/II, while small layer V pyramids could not. One prediction from the present data would be that neither descending layer V inputs to the striatum or thalamus, nor transcallosal connections would be readily activated by longer distance cortico-cortical ""feedback"" connections that terminated in layers I/II.

Both terminals and cell bodies labeled by transport along axon collaterals in the gray matter formed intrinsic clusters which were arrayed as a series of discontinuous stripes of similar size and shape. The co-registration of anterograde and retrograde transport confirmed that these convergent and divergent intrinsic connections also were reciprocal. Transport from the same injection sites along principal axons through the white matter formed associational clusters which were also arrayed as a series of discontinuous stripes. The dimensions of the anterogradely- and retrogradely-labeled associational stripes were very similar to each other and to the intrinsic stripes. These findings demonstrate that divergence, convergence, and reciprocity characterize both the intrinsic and associational excitatory connections in the prefrontal cortex. These patterns of connections provide an anatomical substrate by which activation of a discrete group of neurons would lead to the recruitment of a specific neuronal network comprised of both local and distant groups of cells.

Although previous thalamostriatal studies emphasize projections from the intralaminar nuclei, studies in primates show a substantial projection from the ventral anterior (VA) and ventral lateral (VL) nuclei. These nuclei make up the main efferent projection from the basal ganglia to frontal cortical areas, including primary motor, supplementary, premotor, and cingulate motor areas. Functionally related motor areas of the frontal cortex and VA/VL have convergent projections to specific regions of the dorsal striatum. The distribution of VA/VL terminals within the striatum is crucial to understanding their relationship to motor cortical afferents. We placed anterograde tracer injections into discrete VA/VL thalamic areas. VA/VL thalamostriatal projections terminate in broad, rostrocaudal regions of the dorsal striatum, corresponding to regions innervated by functionally related cortical motor areas. The pars oralis division of VL projects primarily to the dorsolateral, postcommissural putamen, whereas the parvicellular VA targets more medial and rostral putamen regions, and the magnocellular division of VA targets the dorsal head of the caudate nucleus. Whereas these results demonstrate a general functional topography, specific VA/VL projections overlap extensively, suggesting that functionally distinct VA/VL projections may also converge in dorsal striatal areas. Within striatal territories, VA/VL projections terminate in a patchy, nonhomogeneous manner, indicating another level of complexity. Moreover, terminal fields contain both terminal clusters and scattered, long, unbranched fibers with many varicosities.

To gain insight into the organization of these circuits, intracortical connections of major laminar and sublaminar divisions were retrogradely labeled in Walker's area 9 and 46 in rhesus monkeys by using cholera toxin (B-subunit) conjugated to colloidal gold. Microinjections placed within particular cortical laminae produced unique patterns of retrograde labeling. Injections in layers II/III yielded labeling which was laterally widespread (2-7 mm) in supragranular layers, and more narrowly focused, i.e., conforming to a column, in layers IV-VI. In contrast, local circuits associated with layers IV and Vb displayed a regular, cylindrical organization, whereas intrinsic connections of layer Va were laterally extensive (3-5 mm) in layers III and Va. Finally, injections in layer VI gave rise to a narrow column of cell labeling traversing all layers, augmented by laterally extensive labeling (approximately 7 mm) in layer VI.

A.","melchitzky, d. s. gonzalez-burgos, g. barrionuevo, g. lewis, d. a.","The principal axons of supragranular pyramidal neurons in the cerebral cortex travel through the white matter and terminate in other cortical areas, whereas their intrinsic axon collaterals course through the gray matter and form both local and long-distance connections within a cortical region. In the monkey prefrontal cortex (PFC), horizontally oriented, intrinsic axon collaterals from supragranular pyramidal neurons form a series of stripe-like clusters of axon terminals (Levitt et al. [1993] J Comp Neurol 338:360-376; Pucak et al. [1996] J Comp Neurol 376:614-630). The present study examined the synaptic targets of the intrinsic axon collaterals arising from supragranular pyramidal neurons within the same stripe (local projections). Approximately 50% of the within-stripe axon terminals in monkey PFC area 9 targeted dendritic spines. In contrast, for both the intrinsic axon collaterals that travel between stripes (long-range projections), and the axon terminals that project to other PFC areas (associational projections), over 92% of the postsynaptic structures were dendritic spines (Melchitzky et al. [1998] J Comp Neurol 390:211-224). The other 50% of the within-stripe terminals synapsed with dendritic shafts. Dual-labeling studies confirmed that these within-stripe terminals contacted gamma-aminobutyric acid-immunoreactive dendritic shafts, including the subpopulation that contains the calcium-binding protein parvalbumin. The functional significance of the differences in synaptic targets between local and long-range intrinsic axon collaterals was supported by whole-cell, patch clamp recordings in an in vitro slice preparation of monkey PFC. Specifically, the small amplitude responses observed in layer 3 pyramidal neurons during long-range, low-intensity stimulation were exclusively excitatory, whereas local stimulation also evoked di/polysynaptic inhibitory responses. These anatomic and electrophysiological findings suggest that intrinsic connections of the PFC differ from other cortical regions and that within the PFC, feedback (within-stripe) inhibition plays a greater role in regulating the activity of supragranular pyramidal neurons than does feedforward inhibition either between stripes or across regions.",primate,"83.847171, -138.485940",large_blue,2001,(Journal Article),J Comp Neurol,"Animals, Axons/ physiology, Biotin/ analogs & derivatives, Dendrites/metabolism/ultrastructure, Dextrans, Electrophysiology, Macaca fascicularis/ physiology, Male, Microscopy, Electron, Parvalbumins/metabolism, Prefrontal Cortex/cytology/ physiology, Pyramidal Cells/ physiology/ultrastructure, Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S., Synapses/ physiology, gamma-Aminobutyric Acid/metabolism, ","animals, axons/ physiology, biotin/ analogs & derivatives, dendrites/metabolism/ultrastructure, dextrans, electrophysiology, macaca fascicularis/ physiology, male, microscopy, electron, parvalbumins/metabolism, prefrontal cortex/cytology/ physiology, pyramidal cells/ physiology/ultrastructure, research support, u.s. gov't, p.h.s., synapses/ physiology, gamma-aminobutyric acid/metabolism, ",Cortico-hippocampal-Cortical

M.","herrero, m. t. barcia, c. navarro, j. m.","THALAMUS: The human thalamus is a nuclear complex located in the diencephalon and comprising of four parts (the hypothalamus, the epythalamus, the ventral thalamus, and the dorsal thalamus). The thalamus is a relay centre subserving both sensory and motor mechanisms. Thalamic nuclei (50-60 nuclei) project to one or a few well-defined cortical areas. Multiple cortical areas receive afferents from a single thalamic nucleus and send back information to different thalamic nuclei. The corticofugal projection provides positive feedback to the ""correct"" input, while at the same time suppressing irrelevant information. Topographical organisation of the thalamic afferents and efferents is contralateral, and the lateralisation of the thalamic functions affects both sensory and motoric aspects. Symptoms of lesions located in the thalamus are closely related to the function of the areas involved. An infarction or haemorrhage thalamic lesion can develop somatosensory disturbances and/or central pain in the opposite hemibody, analgesic or purely algesic thalamic syndrome characterised by contralateral anaesthesia (or hypaesthesia), contralateral weakness, ataxia and, often, persistent spontaneous pain. BASAL GANGLIA: Basal ganglia form a major centre in the complex extrapyramidal motor system, as opposed to the pyramidal motor system (corticobulbar and corticospinal pathways). Basal ganglia are involved in many neuronal pathways having emotional, motivational, associative and cognitive functions as well. The striatum (caudate nucleus, putamen and nucleus accumbens) receive inputs from all cortical areas and, throughout the thalamus, project principally to frontal lobe areas (prefrontal, premotor and supplementary motor areas) which are concerned with motor planning. These circuits: (i) have an important regulatory influence on cortex, providing information for both automatic and voluntary motor responses to the pyramidal system; (ii) play a role in predicting future events, reinforcing wanted behaviour and suppressing unwanted behaviour, and (iii) are involved in shifting attentional sets and in both high-order processes of movement initiation and spatial working memory. Basal ganglia-thalamo-cortical circuits maintain somatotopic organisation of movement-related neurons throughout the circuit. These circuits reveal functional subdivisions of the oculomotor, prefrontal and cingulate circuits, which play an important role in attention, learning and potentiating behaviour-guiding rules. Involvement of the basal ganglia is related to involuntary and stereotyped movements or paucity of movements without involvement of voluntary motor functions, as in Parkinson's disease, Wilson's disease, progressive supranuclear palsy or Huntington's disease. The symptoms differ with the location of the lesion. The commonest disturbances in basal ganglia lesions are abulia (apathy with loss of initiative and of spontaneous thought and emotional responses) and dystonia, which become manifest as behavioural and motor disturbances, respectively.",unknown,"75.514812, -116.067830",large_blue,2002,(Journal Article),Childs Nerv Syst,"Basal Ganglia/ anatomy & histology/ physiology, Brain Mapping, Humans, Motor Activity, Movement, Movement Disorders/physiopathology, Neural Pathways/cytology/physiology, Neurons, Afferent/physiology, Neurons, Efferent/physiology, Parkinson Disease/physiopathology, Psychomotor Performance, Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't, Thalamus/ anatomy & histology/ physiology, ","basal ganglia/ anatomy & histology/ physiology, brain mapping, humans, motor activity, movement, movement disorders/physiopathology, neural pathways/cytology/physiology, neurons, afferent/physiology, neurons, efferent/physiology, parkinson disease/physiopathology, psychomotor performance, research support, non-u.s. gov't, thalamus/ anatomy & histology/ physiology, ",Cortico-basalGanglia-thalamo-cortical

M.","gimenez-amaya, j. m. graybiel, a. m.","It is well known that the striatum has a chemical architecture dividing it into striosomes and matrix, and that these compartments have different input-output connections. However, striatal afferent-fiber systems also form vividly patchy terminal fields in the matrix, and studies in the past year have uncovered instances of nonstriosomal clustering of striatal output neurons. In the experiments reported here, we systematically investigated this output-neuron clustering in the primate, using the striatopallidal system as a model. Our goals were to determine whether the modular organization is a general characteristic of projection neurons in the striatal matrix, whether the modularity occurs independent of striosomal boundaries, and whether the output modules are systematically organized. We studied the distribution of striatopallidal projection neurons in 9 adult squirrel monkeys by centering deposits of the retrograde tracer HRP-WGA in either the external segment or the internal segment of the globus pallidus. Following injections of each type, many retrogradely labeled neurons appeared in the striatal matrix in clusters and bands having cross-sectional diameters of 0.2-0.8 mm. Comparisons with adjoining sections stained to demonstrate striosomes established that the local groups of striatal output neurons sometimes abutted striosomes but often did not. The retrogradely labeled clusters and bands appeared both in the caudate nucleus and in the putamen. Their arrangements were regular and often periodic. These findings suggest that the large matrix compartment of the primate striatum, which is the primary site of origin of striatal outputs to the pallidum and the reticular part of the substantia nigra, contains systematic mosaics of projection neurons. We propose that this output-neuron modularity of the striatal matrix in the primate could serve as the template for redistribution of the massive afferent-fiber systems of the striatum into specialized striatopallidal output channels.",primate,"78.261238, -115.876645",large_blue,1991,(Journal Article),J Neurosci,"Animals, Axonal Transport, Caudate Nucleus/anatomy & histology, Corpus Striatum/ anatomy & histology/cytology, Globus Pallidus/anatomy & histology, Horseradish Peroxidase, Neurons/ cytology, Putamen/anatomy & histology, Saimiri/ anatomy & histology, Wheat Germ Agglutinin-Horseradish Peroxidase Conjugate, Wheat Germ Agglutinins, ","animals, axonal transport, caudate nucleus/anatomy & histology, corpus striatum/ anatomy & histology/cytology, globus pallidus/anatomy & histology, horseradish peroxidase, neurons/ cytology, putamen/anatomy & histology, saimiri/ anatomy & histology, wheat germ agglutinin-horseradish peroxidase conjugate, wheat germ agglutinins, ",Cortico-basalGanglia-thalamo-cortical

In the present study, the axonal arborizations of single striosome projection neurons in rat neostriatum were visualized in their entirety using a viral vector expressing membrane-targeted green fluorescent protein, and compared with that of matrix projection neurons. We found that not only matrix but also striosome compartments contained direct and indirect pathway neurons. Furthermore, only striatonigral neurons in the striosome compartment projected directly to the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc), although they sent a substantial number of axon collaterals to the globus pallidus, entopeduncular nucleus and/or substantia nigra pars reticulata. These results suggest that striosome neurons play a more important role in the formation of reward-related signals of SNc dopaminergic neurons than do matrix neurons.

253,The parahippocampal region: corticocortico connectivity,Rebecca D. Burwell,rebecca d. burwell,"The parahippocampal region, as defined in this review, comprises the cortical regions that surround the rodent hippocampus including the perirhinal, postrhinal, and entorhinal cortices. The comparable regions in the primate brain are the perirhinal, parahippocampal, and entorhinal cortices. The perirhinal and postrhinal/parahippocampal cortices provide the major polysensory input to the hippocampus through their entorhinal connections and are the recipients of differing combinations of sensory information. The differences in the perirhinal and postrhinal cortical afferentation have important functional implications, in part, because these two regions project with different terminal patterns to the entorhinal cortex. The perirhinal cortex projects preferentially to the lateral entorhinal area (LEA), and the postrhinal cortex projects preferentially to the medial entorhinal area (MEA) and the caudal portion of LEA. Although the perirhinal and postrhinal cortices provide the major cortical input to the entorhinal cortex, the entorhinal cortex itself receives some direct cortical input. An examination of the cortical afferentation of the entorhinal cortex reveals an interesting principle of connectivity among these regions; the composition of the direct neocortical input to the LEA is more similar to that of the perirhinal cortex, and the composition of the direct neocortical input to the MEA is more similar to that of the postrhinal cortex. Thus, polymodal associational input to the LEA and the MEA exhibits some segregation and is organized in parallel. The organization of intrinsic connections for each of the parahippocampal regions also contributes to the segregation of information into parallel pathways.",primate,"79.958102, -165.471684",large_blue,2000,(Journal Article),Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences,,,Cortico-hippocampal-Cortical
182,The primate basal ganglia: parallel and integrative networks,"Haber, S. N.","haber, s. n.","The basal ganglia and frontal cortex operate together to execute goal directed behaviors. This requires not only the execution of motor plans, but also the behaviors that lead to this execution, including emotions and motivation that drive behaviors, cognition that organizes and plans the general strategy, motor planning, and finally, the execution of that plan. The components of the frontal cortex that mediate these behaviors, are reflected in the organization, physiology, and connections between areas of frontal cortex and in their projections through basal ganglia circuits. This comprises a series of parallel pathways. However, this model does not address how information flows between circuits thereby developing new learned behaviors (or actions) from a combination of inputs from emotional, cognitive, and motor cortical areas. Recent anatomical evidence from primates demonstrates that the neuro-networks within basal ganglia pathways are in a position to move information across functional circuits. Two networks are: the striato-nigral-striatal network and the thalamo-cortical-thalamic network. Within each of these sets of connected structures, there are both reciprocal connections linking up regions associated with similar functions and non-reciprocal connections linking up regions that are associated with different cortical basal ganglia circuits. Each component of information (from limbic to motor outcome) sends both feedback connection, and also a feedforward connection, allowing the transfer of information. Information is channeled from limbic, to cognitive, to motor circuits. Action decision-making processes are thus influenced by motivation and cognitive inputs, allowing the animal to respond appropriate to environmental cues.",unknown,"75.246768, -116.067830",large_blue,2003,(Journal Article),J Chem Neuroanat,"Animals, Basal Ganglia/ anatomy & histology/physiology, Humans, Mental Processes/ physiology, Neural Pathways/ anatomy & histology/physiology, Primates/ anatomy & histology/physiology, Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S., ","animals, basal ganglia/ anatomy & histology/physiology, humans, mental processes/ physiology, neural pathways/ anatomy & histology/physiology, primates/ anatomy & histology/physiology, research support, u.s. gov't, p.h.s., ",Cortico-basalGanglia-thalamo-cortical
183,Basal ganglia and cerebellar loops: motor and cognitive circuits,Frank A. Middleton Peter L. Strick,frank a. middleton peter l. strick,"The traditional view that the basal ganglia and cerebellum are simply involved in the control of movement has been challenged in recent years. One of the pivotal reasons for this reappraisal has been new information about basal ganglia and cerebellar connections with the cerebral cortex. In essence, recent anatomical studies have revealed that these connections are organized into discrete circuits or 'loops'. Rather than serving as a means for widespread cortical areas to gain access to the motor system, these loops reciprocally interconnect a large and diverse set of cerebral cortical areas with the basal ganglia and cerebellum. The properties of neurons within the basal ganglia or cerebellar components of these circuits resembles the properties of neurons within the cortical areas subserved by these loops. For example, neuronal activity within basal ganglia and cerebellar loops with motor areas of the cerebral cortex is highly correlated with parameters of movement, while neuronal activity within basal ganglia and cerebellar loops with areas of the prefrontal cortex is more related to aspects of cognitive function. Thus, individual loops appear to be involved in distinct behavioral functions. Studies of basal ganglia and cerebellar pathology support this conclusion. Damage to the basal ganglia or cerebellar components of circuits with motor areas of cortex leads to motor symptoms, whereas damage of the subcortical components of circuits with non-motor areas of cortex causes higher-order deficits. In this report, we review some of the new anatomical, physiological and behavioral findings that have contributed to a reappraisal of function concerning the basal ganglia and cerebellar loops with the cerebral cortex.",unknown,"75.514812, -117.275621",large_blue,2000,(Journal Article),Brain Research Reviews,,,Cortico-basalGanglia-thalamo-cortical

Twenty years ago, investigators proposed that the striatum's ability to use dopamine (DA) rise and fall to control action selection was due to the segregation of D(1) and D(2) DA receptors in direct- and indirect-pathway spiny projection neurons. Although this hypothesis sparked a debate, the evidence that has accumulated since then clearly supports this model. Recent advances in the means of marking neural circuits with optical or molecular reporters have revealed a clear-cut dichotomy between these two cell types at the molecular, anatomical, and physiological levels. The contrast provided by these studies has provided new insights into how the striatum responds to fluctuations in DA signaling and how diseases that alter this signaling change striatal function.",unknown,"75.384316, -116.067830",large_blue,2010,(Journal Article),Annu Rev Neurosci,,,Cortico-basalGanglia-thalamo-cortical

These projections originate largely from infragranular layers V and VI. To examine whether the striatal and thalamic connections from the prefrontal cortex arise from separate neuronal populations or are collateralized, two different fluorescent retrograde tracers (diamidino yellow and fast blue) were injected into topographically similar regions of the head of the caudate nucleus and the mediodorsal nucleus in the same animal. The results show that although prefrontostriatal and prefrontothalamic projections arise from similar topographic regions, their laminar origins are distinctive. The connections to the head of the caudate nucleus originate mainly from layer Va, to a lesser extent from layer Vb, with a minor contribution from layers III and VI. In contrast, the projections to the mediodorsal nucleus emanate largely from layer VI, and also from layer Vb. Only occasional double-labeled neurons were observed, indicating that prefrontostriatal and prefrontothalamic connections originate from separate neuronal populations.

The objective of this commentary is to build upon the established model of the basal ganglia connectivity and review new anatomical findings that lead to the refinement of some aspects of the model.

M.","lee, c. r. tepper, j. m.","Although substantia nigra dopaminergic neurons are spontaneously active both in vivo and in vitro, this activity does not depend on afferent input as these neurons express an endogenous calcium-dependent oscillatory mechanism sufficient to drive action potential generation. However, afferents to these neurons, a large proportion of them GABAergic and arising from other nuclei in the basal ganglia, play a crucial role in modulating the activity of dopaminergic neurons. In the absence of afferent activity or when in brain slices, dopaminergic neurons fire in a very regular, pacemaker-like mode. Phasic activity in GABAergic, glutamatergic, and cholinergic inputs modulates the pacemaker activity into two other modes. The most common is a random firing pattern in which interspike intervals assume a Poisson-like distribution, and a less common pattern, often in response to a conditioned stimulus or a reward in which the neurons fire bursts of 2-8 spikes time-locked to the stimulus. Typically in vivo, all three firing patterns are observed, intermixed, in single nigrostriatal neurons varying over time. Although the precise mechanism(s) underlying the burst are currently the focus of intensive study, it is obvious that bursting must be triggered by afferent inputs. Most of the afferents to substantia nigra pars compacta dopaminergic neurons comprise monosynaptic inputs from GABAergic projection neurons in the ipsilateral neostriatum, the globus pallidus, and the substantia nigra pars reticulata. A smaller fraction of the basal ganglia inputs, something less than 30%, are glutamatergic and arise principally from the ipsilateral subthalamic nucleus and pedunculopontine nucleus. The pedunculopontine nucleus also sends a cholinergic input to nigral dopaminergic neurons. The GABAergic pars reticulata projection neurons also receive inputs from all of these sources, in some cases relaying them disynaptically to the dopaminergic neurons, thereby playing a particularly significant role in setting and/or modulating the firing pattern of the nigrostriatal neurons.",unknown,"76.255600, -126.584092",large_blue,2009,(Journal Article),J Neural Transm Suppl,"Animals, Basal Ganglia/ physiology, Dopamine/ metabolism, Humans, Models, Neurological, Nerve Net/physiology, Neural Pathways/physiology, Neurons/ physiology/ultrastructure, Parkinson Disease/pathology, Substantia Nigra/ cytology, Synapses/physiology/ultrastructure, gamma-Aminobutyric Acid/metabolism, ","animals, basal ganglia/ physiology, dopamine/ metabolism, humans, models, neurological, nerve net/physiology, neural pathways/physiology, neurons/ physiology/ultrastructure, parkinson disease/pathology, substantia nigra/ cytology, synapses/physiology/ultrastructure, gamma-aminobutyric acid/metabolism, ",Cortico-basalGanglia-thalamo-cortical
188,Towards the classification of subpopulations of layer V pyramidal projection neurons,"Molnar, Z. Cheung, A. F.","molnar, z. cheung, a. f.","The nature of cerebral cortical circuitry has been increasingly clarified by markers for the identification of precise cell types with specific morphology, connectivity and distinct physiological properties. Molecular markers are not only helpful in dissecting cortical circuitry, but also give insight into the mechanisms of cortical neuronal specification and differentiation. The two principal neuronal types of the cerebral cortex are the pyramidal and GABAergic cells. Pyramidal cells are excitatory and project to distant targets, while GABAergic neurons are mostly inhibitory non-pyramidal interneurons. Reliable markers for specific subtypes of interneurons are available and have been employed in the classification and functional analysis of cortical circuitry. Until recently, cortical pyramidal neurons have been considered a homogeneous class of cells. This concept is now changing as the powerful tools of molecular biology and genetics identify molecular tags for subtypes of pyramidal cells such as: Otx-1 [Frantz, G.D., Bohner, A.P., Akers, R.M., McConnell, S.K., 1994.

In the present study, by using awake monkeys, the polysynaptic effects of electrical stimulation in the forelimb regions of the primary motor and primary somatosensory cortices on the activity of globus pallidus (GP) neurons, especially mediated by the subthalamic nucleus (STN), have been characterized. Cortical stimulation induced an early, short-latency excitation followed by an inhibition and a late excitation in neurons of both the external and internal segments of the GP. It also induced an early, short-latency excitation followed by a late excitation and an inhibition in STN neurons. The early excitation in STN neurons preceded that in GP neurons. Blockade of STN neuronal activity by muscimol (GABA(A) receptor agonist) injection resulted in abolishment of both the early and late excitations evoked in GP neurons by cortical stimulation. At the same time, the spontaneous discharge rate of GP neurons decreased, pauses between the groups of spikes of GP neurons became prominent, and the firing pattern became regular. Injection of (+/-)-3-(2-carboxypiperazin-4-yl)-propyl-1-phosphonic acid (CPP) [N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist], but not 1,2,3, 4-tetrahydro-6-nitro-2,3-dioxo-benzo[f]quinoxaline-7-sulfonamide disodium [NBQX (non-NMDA receptor antagonist)], into the STN attenuated the early and late excitations in GP neurons, suggesting that cortico-subthalamic transmission is mediated mainly by NMDA receptors. Interference with the pallido-subthalamic transmission by bicuculline (GABA(A) receptor antagonist) injection into the STN made the inhibition distinct without affecting the early excitation. The present results indicate that the cortico-subthalamo-pallidal pathway conveys powerful excitatory effects from the motor-related cortical areas to the GP with shorter conduction time than the effects conveyed through the striatum.",primate,"77.844496, -130.174283",large_blue,2000,(Journal Article),J Neurophysiol,"Animals, Bicuculline/pharmacology, Brain Mapping, Cerebral Cortex/ cytology/physiology, Electric Stimulation, Electrophysiology, Excitatory Amino Acid Antagonists/pharmacology, Female, GABA Agonists/pharmacology, GABA Antagonists/pharmacology, Globus Pallidus/ cytology/physiology, Macaca, Membrane Potentials/drug effects/physiology, Microinjections, Muscimol/pharmacology, Neural Pathways, Neurons/ physiology, Piperazines/pharmacology, Quinoxalines/pharmacology, Reaction Time/physiology, Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't, Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S., Subthalamic Nucleus/ cytology/physiology, ","animals, bicuculline/pharmacology, brain mapping, cerebral cortex/ cytology/physiology, electric stimulation, electrophysiology, excitatory amino acid antagonists/pharmacology, female, gaba agonists/pharmacology, gaba antagonists/pharmacology, globus pallidus/ cytology/physiology, macaca, membrane potentials/drug effects/physiology, microinjections, muscimol/pharmacology, neural pathways, neurons/ physiology, piperazines/pharmacology, quinoxalines/pharmacology, reaction time/physiology, research support, non-u.s. gov't, research support, u.s. gov't, p.h.s., subthalamic nucleus/ cytology/physiology, ",Cortico-basalGanglia-thalamo-cortical

Tanji, J.","sakai, s. t. inase, m. tanji, j.","To address the question of segregated projections from the internal segment of the globus pallidus (GPi) and the cerebellar nuclei (Cb) to the thalamus in the monkey, we employed a double anterograde labeling strategy combining the anterograde transport of horseradish peroxidase conjugated to wheat germ agglutinin (WGA-HRP) with biotinylated dextran amine (BDA) transport. The tissue was processed sequentially for WGA-HRP, and then BDA immunohistochemistry using two different chromogens. Since the two labels were easily distinguishable on the same histological section, the interrelationship between the cerebellar and pallidal projection systems could be directly evaluated. We found that both the cerebellothalamic and pallidothalamic label consisted of dense plexuses of labeled fibers and swellings in a patch-like configuration. The patches or foci of labeling were distributed either as dense single label or as interdigitating patches of double label. We found dense single label in the central portion of the ventral anterior nucleus pars principalis (VApc) and the ventral lateral nucleus pars oralis (VLo) following the GPi injections or in the central portion of the ventral posterior lateral nucleus pars oralis (VPLo) and nucleus X (X) following the cerebellar nuclei injections. Complementary interdigitating patches of WGA-HRP and BDA labeling were found primarily in transitional border regions between thalamic nuclei. On occasion, we found overlap of both labels. We observed a gradient pattern in the density of the pallidothalamic and cerebellothalamic projections. The pallidothalamic territory included VApc, VLo, and the ventral lateral nucleus pars caudalis (VLc), with the density of these projections decreasing along an anterior to posterior gradient in the thalamus. Occasional patches of pallidal label were found in VPLo and nucleus X. Conversely, the density of cerebellothalamic projections increased along the same gradient, with the cerebellothalamic territory extending anteriorly beyond the cell-sparse zones of VPLo, X, and VLc to include VLo and VApc also.

62,Single-axon tracing study of corticostriatal projections arising from primary motor cortex in primates,"Parent, M. Parent, A.","parent, m. parent, a.","The axonal projections arising from the forelimb area of the primary motor cortex (M1) in cynomolgus monkeys (Macaca fascicularis) were studied following microiontophoretic injections of biotinylated dextran amine under electrophysiological guidance. The microinjections were centered on layer V, and 42 anterogradely labeled corticofugal axons were reconstructed from serial frontal or sagittal sections with a camera lucida. Our investigation shows that the primate striatum receives both direct and indirect projections from M1. The direct corticostriatal projection is formed by axons that remain uniformly thin and unbranched throughout their sinuous trajectory to the ipsilateral striatum. They divide as they enter the dorsolateral sector of the post-commissural putamen, the so-called sensorimotor striatal territory. The indirect corticostriatal projection derives from a thin collateral emitted within the corona radiata by thick, long-range fibers that descend toward the brainstem. The collateral enters the putamen dorsomedially and remains unbranched until it reaches the dorsolateral sector of the putamen, where it breaks out into two to four axonal branches displaying small and equally spaced varicosities. Both direct and indirect corticostriatal axons branch moderately but occupy vast rostrocaudal striatal territories, where they appear to contact en passant several widely distributed striatal neurons. These findings reveal that, in contrast to current beliefs, the primate motor corticostriatal system is not exclusively formed by axons dedicated solely to the striatum. It also comprises collaterals from long-range corticofugal axons, which can thus provide to the striatum a copy of the neural information that is being conveyed to the brainstem and/or spinal cord.",primate,"80.866174, -106.455983",large_blue,2006,(Journal Article),J Comp Neurol,"Afferent Pathways/ anatomy & histology/metabolism, Animals, Axons/metabolism/ physiology, Biotin/analogs & derivatives/pharmacokinetics, Comparative Study, Corpus Striatum/ cytology/metabolism, Dextrans/pharmacokinetics, Electron Transport Complex IV/ metabolism, Female, Macaca fascicularis, Male, Motor Cortex/ cytology, Neurons/ cytology/physiology, ","afferent pathways/ anatomy & histology/metabolism, animals, axons/metabolism/ physiology, biotin/analogs & derivatives/pharmacokinetics, comparative study, corpus striatum/ cytology/metabolism, dextrans/pharmacokinetics, electron transport complex iv/ metabolism, female, macaca fascicularis, male, motor cortex/ cytology, neurons/ cytology/physiology, ",Cortico-pontine

Analysis was focused mainly on the dorsal part of area TE, in which a functional columnar organization has been shown. Interlaminar connections were analyzed in coronal section after laminar-specific microinjections, and intralaminar connections were examined from tangential sections. After injections at various depths in the dorsal TE, both axons and cell bodies were strongly labeled above or below the injection site in a columnar appearance. Axons from layer 3 ran in bundles towards the white matter and gave off prominent collaterals in layer 5. Ascending axons from lower to upper layers were also present (e.g., layers 4, 5, and 6 to layer 3). In tangential sections, there were abundant axons running parallel to the pia mater. These horizontal axons, particularly those in layers 2 and 3, produced patches of terminals 0.5 +/- 0.1 mm (mean +/- s.d.) in size and cylindrical in shape, spanning layers 1-3 or even to layers 4 and 5. In the tangential plane, they were distributed in an anisotropic manner around the injection. The farthest patch appeared at 4 mm from the injection site. The center-to-center distance between nearest-neighbor patches was 0.7 +/- 0.3 mm. These patches were found only within the dorsal TE and did not extend into the lower bank of the superior temporal sulcus or into the ventral part of area TE. Area TEO, which is a major afferent source to area TE, had axonal patches with spacing similar to those in area TE but with smaller sizes (0.4 +/- 0.1 mm). The results show that intrinsic horizontal axons both in area TE and in area TEO arborize in a patchy manner, as has been reported for several other cortical areas. In are TE, the size and spacing of the terminal patches match those of columns with similar stimulus selectivity. Thus, these patches may be related to the functional modularity in area TE.

Labelled callosal neurones were mainly in the lower half of layer III, whereas few occurred in infragranular layers. Topographically, the distribution of callosal terminals and cell bodies duplicated the distribution of association terminals and cell bodies labelled in SII on the side ipsilateral to HRP injection. The laminar pattern of termination of association fibres from SI was similar to that of callosal fibres. However, the distribution of association-projecting neurones in SII showed a striking difference from that of callosal-projecting neurones. Unlike the latter neurones, which were mainly located in supragranular layers, association cell bodies overwhelmingly dwelt in layers V and VI and were less numerous in layers II and III. This laminar pattern of association SII-SI cells corresponds to the ""feed-backward"" model and fits the laminar pattern of their axon terminations (Friedman: Brain Res. 273: 147-151, '83). The association and callosal inputs and outputs of area SII are discussed in relation to the function of the forward and backward type of reciprocal connections entertained with SI in the ipsilateral hemisphere and to the function of SII in the interhemispheric exchange of somatosensory information.",primate,"83.358204, -170.953032",large_blue,1986,(Journal Article),J Comp Neurol,"Animals, Association, Cats, Corpus Callosum/ anatomy & histology/physiology, Macaca fascicularis, Mammals, Models, Neurological, Sensation/physiology, Somatosensory Cortex/ anatomy & histology/physiology, Species Specificity, ","animals, association, cats, corpus callosum/ anatomy & histology/physiology, macaca fascicularis, mammals, models, neurological, sensation/physiology, somatosensory cortex/ anatomy & histology/physiology, species specificity, ",Cortico-cortical

Area 24 has three divisions of which area 24a is adjacent to the callosal sulcus and has the least laminar differentiation. Area 24b has more clearly defined layers II, III, and Va, and area 24c, which forms the lower bank of the anterior cingulate sulcus, has a particularly dense layer III. Area 23 also has three divisions, each of which has a distinct layer IV. Area 23a is adjacent to the callosal sulcus and has the thinnest layers II-IV, which have the same cell density as layers V and VI. Area 23b has the largest pyramids in layers IIIc and Va, and area 23c, in the depths of the posterior cingulate sulcus, has the broadest external and thinnest internal pyramidal layers. Finally, areas 29 and 30 are located in the posterior depths of the callosal sulcus. Two divisions of area 29 are apparent: one with a granular layer directly adjacent to layer I (area 29a-c) and another with differentiation of layers III and IV (area 29d). Area 30 has a dysgranular layer IV. Injections of the retrograde tracer horseradish peroxidase (HRP) were made into subdivisions of cingulate cortex in the monkey. Area 25 received thalamic input mainly from the midline parataenial (Pt), central densocellular (Cdc), and reuniens nuclei as well as from the dorsal parvicellular division of the mediodorsal nucleus (MDpc). A less dense projection also originated in the intralaminar parafascicular (Pf), central superior, and limitans (Li) nuclei as well as the medial division of the anterior nuclei (AM).

L.","rockland, k. s. andresen, j. cowie, r. j. robinson, d. l.","The pulvinar nucleus is a major source of input to visual cortical areas, but many important facts are still unknown concerning the organization of pulvinocortical (PC) connections and their possible interactions with other connectional systems. In order to address some of these questions, we labeled PC connections by extracellular injections of biotinylated dextran amine into the lateral pulvinar of two monkeys, and analyzed 25 individual axons in several extrastriate areas by serial section reconstruction. This approach yielded four results: (1) in all extrastriate areas examined (V2, V3, V4, and middle temporal area [MT]/V5), PC axons consistently have 2-6 multiple, spatially distributed arbors; (2) in each area, there is a small number of larger caliber axons, possibly originating from a subpopulation of calbindin-positive giant projection neurons in the pulvinar; (3) as previously reported by others, most terminations in extrastriate areas are concentrated in layer 3, but they can occur in other layers (layers 4,5,6, and, occasionally, layer 1) as collaterals of a single axon; in addition, (4) the size of individual arbors and of the terminal field as a whole varies with cortical area. In areas V2 and V3, there is typically a single principal arbor (0.25-0.50 mm in diameter) and several smaller arbors. In area V4, the principal arbor is larger (2.0- to 2.5-mm-wide), but in area MT/V5, the arbors tend to be smaller (0.15 mm in diameter). Size differences might result from specializations of the target areas, or may be more related to the particular injection site and how this projects to individual cortical areas. Feedforward cortical axons, except in area V2, have multiple arbors, but these do not show any obvious size progression. Thus, in areas V2, V3, and especially V4, PC fields are larger than those of cortical axons, but in MT/V5 they are smaller. Terminal specializations of PC connections tend to be larger than those of corticocortical, but the projection foci are less dense. Further work is necessary to determine the differential interactions within and between systems, and how these might result in the complex patterns of suppression and enhancement, postulated as gating mechanisms in cortical attentional effects, or in different states of arousal.",primate,"82.155571, -132.204544",large_blue,1999,(Journal Article),J Comp Neurol,"Animals, Axons/ physiology/ultrastructure, Brain Mapping, Cerebral Cortex/ physiology/ultrastructure, Female, Image Processing, Computer-Assisted, Macaca mulatta/anatomy & histology/ physiology, Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S., Thalamic Nuclei/ physiology/ultrastructure, Visual Pathways/ physiology/ultrastructure, ","animals, axons/ physiology/ultrastructure, brain mapping, cerebral cortex/ physiology/ultrastructure, female, image processing, computer-assisted, macaca mulatta/anatomy & histology/ physiology, research support, u.s. gov't, p.h.s., thalamic nuclei/ physiology/ultrastructure, visual pathways/ physiology/ultrastructure, ",Cortico-thalamo-cortical

Each area of prefrontal, premotor, or motor cortex injected was found to receive a topographically unique thalamic input from clusters of cells in specific subdivisions within MD. All of the prefrontal areas examined also receive topographically organized inputs from other thalamic nuclei including, most prominently, the ventral anterior (VA) and medial pulvinar nuclei. Conversely, and in agreement with previous findings, MD projects to areas of the frontal lobe beyond the traditional borders of prefrontal cortex, such as the anterior cingulate and supplementary motor cortex. The topography of thalamocortical neurons revealed in coronal sections through VA, MD, and pulvinar is circumferential. In the medial part of MD, for example, thalamocortical neurons shift from a dorsal to a ventral position for cortical targets lying medial to lateral along the ventral surface of the lobe; neurons in the lateral MD move from a ventral to a dorsal position, for cortical areas situated lateral to medial on the convexity of the hemisphere. The aggregate evidence for topographic specificity is supported further by experiments in which different fluorescent dyes were placed in multiple areas of the frontal lobe in each of three cases. The results show that very few, if any, thalamic neurons project to more than one area of cortex. The widespread cortical targets of MD neurons together with evidence for multiple thalamic inputs to prefrontal areas support a revision of the classical hodological definition of prefrontal cortex as the exclusive cortical recipient of MD projections.

Pyramidal neurones in the precentral motor area of the monkey were studied using intracellular techniques. Pyramidal tract neurones (PTNs) were identified by antidromic activation from the cerebral peduncles or medullary pyramids. Orthodromic responses were recorded in PTNs and in other pyramidal neurones when antidromic volleys were set up by stimulation of the peduncles or pyramids. The neurones were then labelled by intracellular ionophoresis of horseradish peroxidase and their morphology examined. All neurones studied were identified as pyramidal cells according to their morphology. 2. Six pyramidal neurones located in lamina V were well stained; they included two fast PTNs and two slow PTNs. The morphology of all pyramidal neurones in this lamina (fast PTNs, slow PTNs and those pyramidal cells that were not antidromically characterized) was essentially similar. A single apical dendrite branched as it ascended and its terminals arborized subpially. Numerous lateral and oblique dendrites branched from the apical dendrites in lamina V and near its border with lamina III: short basal dendrites arborized in the vicinity of the soma in lamina V. Long basal dendrites had a wider field of arborization in lamina V and sometimes extended into lamina VI. 3. Three to five collaterals arose from the axon of lamina V cells in the cortex and arborized in laminae V and VI. Short collateral branches arborized in the vicinity of the soma in the region of the basal and lateral dendrites. Long collateral branches could be traced over long distances (often more than 1 mm). One pyramidal neurone in this lamina (a fast PTN) lacked short collateral branches from the axon. 4. Four pyramidal neurones in lamina III were stained well. The dendritic morphology of all these neurones was similar. Apical dendrites branched as they ascended and terminated subpially. Lateral and basal dendrites formed a column of dendritic branches around the soma. No long basal dendrites were seen. 5. The number and arborization of intracortical collaterals from the axon of lamina III cells varied widely; from three to twelve collaterals arose from the axon. The biggest arbor of collateral branches involved all the cortical laminae and was about 3 mm wide mediolaterally, while the smallest arbor was restricted mainly to lamina III in the vicinity of the soma.

Modules are most commonly grouped into entities by sets of dominating external connections. This unifying factor is most obvious for the heterotypical sensory and motor areas of the neocortex. Columnar defining factors in homotypical areas are generated, in part, within the cortex itself. The set of all modules composing such an entity may be fractionated into different modular subsets by different extrinsic connections. Linkages between them and subsets in other large entities form distributed systems. The neighborhood relations between connected subsets of modules in different entities result in nested distributed systems that serve distributed functions. A cortical area defined in classical cytoarchitectural terms may belong to more than one and sometimes to several distributed systems. Columns in cytoarchitectural areas located at some distance from one another, but with some common properties, may be linked by long-range, intracortical connections.",primate,"80.728826, -106.457172",large_blue,1997,(Journal Article),Brain,"Animals, Brain Mapping, Cell Division, Cell Movement, Cerebral Cortex/ cytology, Humans, Models, Neurological, Neurons/cytology/physiology, ","animals, brain mapping, cell division, cell movement, cerebral cortex/ cytology, humans, models, neurological, neurons/cytology/physiology, ",Cortico-pontine
75,The neostriatal mosaic: striatal patch-matrix organization is related to cortical lamination,"Gerfen, C. R.","gerfen, c. r.","The basal ganglia, of which the striatum is the major component, process inputs from virtually all cerebral cortical areas to affect motor, emotional, and cognitive behaviors. Insights into how these seemingly disparate functions may be integrated have emerged from studies that have demonstrated that the mammalian striatum is composed of two compartments arranged as a mosaic, the patches and the matrix, which differ in their neurochemical and neuroanatomical properties. In this study, projections from prefrontal, cingulate, and motor cortical areas to the striatal compartments were examined with the Phaseolus vulgaris-leucoagglutinin (PHA-L) anterograde axonal tracer in rats. Each cortical area projects to both the patches and the matrix of the striatum; however, deep layer V and layer VI corticostriatal neurons project principally to the patches, whereas superficial layer V and layer III and II corticostriatal neurons project principally to the matrix. The relative contribution of patch and matrix corticostriatal projections varies among the cortical areas examined such that allocortical areas provide a greater number of inputs to the patches than to the matrix, whereas the reverse obtains for neocortical areas. These results demonstrate that the compartmental organization of corticostriatal inputs is related to their laminar origin and secondarily to the cytoarchitectonic area of origin.",mammal,"79.303062, -120.111695",large_blue,1989,(Journal Article),Science,"Animals, Corpus Striatum/ anatomy & histology, Immunohistochemistry, Phytohemagglutinins, Rats, Rats, Inbred Strains, ","animals, corpus striatum/ anatomy & histology, immunohistochemistry, phytohemagglutinins, rats, rats, inbred strains, ",Cortico-pontine

HRP injections in the SSM cortex label cells in layers II-VI of ipsilateral and contralateral cortical areas. However, the majority of these cortico-cortical cells are found in the supragranular layers. Examination of the size, shape and laminar position of retrogradely labeled layer V neurons after injections in each of these areas suggests that none of these features can be used to predict accurately the projection target of individual neurons.

In turn, the CM/Pf complex receives a substantial innervation from the internal globus pallidus (GPi). In this study, we demonstrate that the substantia nigra pars reticulata (SNr) also provides a massive input to Pf in monkeys. These pallidothalamic and nigrothalamic projections provide routes whereby information can flow in functional loops between the basal ganglia and the intralaminar nuclear group. To understand better the anatomical organization and the degree of functional specificity of these loops, we combined retrograde and anterograde labeling methods from functionally defined regions of the striatum and GPi/SNr to determine the relationships between thalamostriatal neurons and basal ganglia afferents. Together with previous studies, our data suggest the existence of tightly connected functional circuits between the basal ganglia and the CM/Pf in primates: 1) A ""sensorimotor"" circuit links together the medial two-thirds of CM, the postcommissural putamen, and the ventrolateral part of the caudal GPi; 2) a ""limbic"" circuit involves the rostral one-third of Pf, the ventral striatum, and the rostromedial pole of GPi; and 3) an ""associative""circuit exists between the caudal two-thirds of Pf, the caudate nucleus, and the SNr. An additional ""associative"" circuit that involves the caudate-receiving territory of GPi (dorsal one-third), the dorsolateral Pf (Pfdl), and the precommissural putamen was also disclosed.

Injections of tracers centered on the central/lateral PM resulted in labeling of dorsolateral and orbital regions, whereas injections centered on caudal, medial PM resulted in labeling of dorsomedial and medial PFC.

The results of this series of tracer injections confirmed the results of thalamic injections.

Area 24 has three divisions of which area 24a is adjacent to the callosal sulcus and has the least laminar differentiation. Area 24b has more clearly defined layers II, III, and Va, and area 24c, which forms the lower bank of the anterior cingulate sulcus, has a particularly dense layer III. Area 23 also has three divisions, each of which has a distinct layer IV. Area 23a is adjacent to the callosal sulcus and has the thinnest layers II-IV, which have the same cell density as layers V and VI. Area 23b has the largest pyramids in layers IIIc and Va, and area 23c, in the depths of the posterior cingulate sulcus, has the broadest external and thinnest internal pyramidal layers. Finally, areas 29 and 30 are located in the posterior depths of the callosal sulcus. Two divisions of area 29 are apparent: one with a granular layer directly adjacent to layer I (area 29a-c) and another with differentiation of layers III and IV (area 29d). Area 30 has a dysgranular layer IV. Injections of the retrograde tracer horseradish peroxidase (HRP) were made into subdivisions of cingulate cortex in the monkey.

It is currently the most efficient target for deep brain stimulations designed to alleviate symptoms of Parkinson's disease. STN neurons were analyzed by applying stereological methods and single/double-immunostaining procedures to postmortem material obtained from normal individuals. Besides a multitude of closely packed projection neurons ( approximately 24.7 mum in diameter), the human STN (mean volume, 174.5 +/- 20.4 mm3; total neuronal density, 239.5 +/- 31.9 x 10(3)) contained smaller neurons (approximately 12.2 microm), which displayed glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD)(65/67) immunoreactivity and shared the morphological features of interneurons described in Golgi studies of primate STN. These putative gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)ergic interneurons accounted for 7.5% of the total neuronal population of the STN. Although present throughout the nucleus, they were significantly more numerous in its posterior-ventral-medial sector, which belongs to the limbic/associative functional territory. Many projection neurons located dorsolaterally in the STN showed parvalbumin immunoreactivity and others lying ventromedially displayed calretinin immunostaining, but none of the GAD-positive interneurons expressed these calcium-binding proteins. Although less abundant than projection neurons, GABAergic interneurons might play a important role in the intrinsic organization of the STN.

The results showed that the laminar origin of both nearby and distant corticocortical projections was correlated with the architectonic differentiation of the regions giving rise to the projecting afferent fibers. Frontally directed projections from limbic cortices, which show a rudimentary laminar organization, emanated mainly from deep layers. On the other hand, projections from increasingly more differentiated cortices arose progressively from the upper (or supragranular) layers. This pattern was observed for projections originating along the axis of architectonic differentiation of the visual, somatosensory, auditory, motor, and prefrontal cortical systems.

The entire dendritic arbor of individual subtypes in layers III, V, and VI was restricted to a few cortical layers, but as a group these cells had dendrites spanning the whole cortical depth.

A.","soloway, a. s. pucak, m. l. melchitzky, d. s. lewis, d. a.","Subpopulations of cortical pyramidal neurons have been distinguished based on the projection target of their principal axons or by their dendritic morphology. In this study, we sought to test the hypothesis that pyramidal neurons in monkey prefrontal cortex that furnish callosal or ipsilateral projections have distinctive dendritic morphologies. Retrogradely-labeled, Fast Blue-containing callosal and ipsilateral neurons were intracellularly filled with Lucifer Yellow, immunoconverted, and reconstructed. Quantitative measurements of the size and complexity of the dendritic arbor, including total dendritic length, horizontal extent, number of branch points, maximum branch order, and number of segments, as well as spine density, were made. In general, callosal neurons had larger and more complex dendritic arbors for both apical and basilar dendritic trees than did ipsilateral neurons. The greatest difference was in total dendritic length; the apical and basilar trees of callosal neurons were 34 and 25% longer, respectively. In addition, spine density was also significantly greater on the apical and basilar dendrites of callosal neurons. These findings could not be explained by differences in somal size or completeness of dendritic filling between callosal and ipsilateral neurons. Our observations support the hypothesis that callosal and ipsilateral neurons differ on a number of measures of dendritic size and complexity. Furthermore, these findings imply that these two subpopulations of pyramidal cells differ in the number and perhaps types of excitatory inputs that they receive. Finally, differences in the dendritic morphology of callosal and ipsilateral neurons have implications for understanding the functional attributes of these two populations of cells, as well as for the characterization of pyramidal neurons in human disease states.",primate,"81.687734, -153.184952",large_blue,2002,(Journal Article),Neuroscience,"Amidines/diagnostic use, Animals, Cell Size/physiology, Corpus Callosum/ cytology/physiology, Dendrites/physiology/ ultrastructure, Fluorescent Dyes/diagnostic use, Immunohistochemistry, Isoquinolines/diagnostic use, Laterality/ physiology, Macaca fascicularis/ anatomy & histology/physiology, Male, Neural Pathways/ cytology/physiology, Prefrontal Cortex/ cytology/physiology, Pyramidal Cells/ cytology/physiology, Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S., ","amidines/diagnostic use, animals, cell size/physiology, corpus callosum/ cytology/physiology, dendrites/physiology/ ultrastructure, fluorescent dyes/diagnostic use, immunohistochemistry, isoquinolines/diagnostic use, laterality/ physiology, macaca fascicularis/ anatomy & histology/physiology, male, neural pathways/ cytology/physiology, prefrontal cortex/ cytology/physiology, pyramidal cells/ cytology/physiology, research support, u.s. gov't, p.h.s., ",Cortico-cortical

Spiny stellate cells in the auditory areas show a great variety of their dendritic arborization pattern. The presence of all intermediate forms between small pyramidal cells--which constitute the dominant cell type in layer IV and which display an extraordinary heteromorphism--and spiny stellate cells shows the close kinship between both neuronal types. The morphology and distribution of spines along the dendrites of spiny stellate neurons are similar to those of the small pyramidal cells of the same layer. The axons, which were impregnated only in their proximal portions, mostly descend, giving rise to recurrent ascending collaterals, but initially ascending axons do also occur.

Cortical interneurons were identified immunocytochemically by the expression of the calcium binding proteins calretinin (CR), parvalbumin (PV) and calbindin D-28k (CB). Interneurons were also identified using GABA immunocytochemistry. The areal and laminar distributions of CR, PV, and CB cells were consistent across mPFC; their morphological characteristics identified them as local circuit neurons. Throughout layers 2-6: CR immunoreactivity labelled double bouquet and bipolar neurons, PV was localised in large and small basket neurons and in chandelier (axoaxonic) cells, while CB immunoreactivity was present in double bouquet, Martinotti, and neurogliaform neurons. In addition, some cells in layer 1 (including Cajal-Retzius neurons) were CR immunoreactive. Calbindin immunoreactivity also labelled a population of large nonpyramidal neurons deep in the cortex. Other types of CR, PV and CB cells were also immunolabelled. A small population of layer 3 pyramidal cells was weakly CB immunoreactive. Peak cell densities occurred in layer 2/upper layer 3 for CR+ neurons and in upper to midlayer 3 for CB+ cells. PV+ neuron density peaked in midcortex. These observations support and extend a similar study of monkey prefrontal cortex (Conde et al. [1994] J. Comp. Neurol. 341:95-116). The morphologies and combined cortical depth distributions of CR+, PV+, and CB+ neurons were similar to GABA-immunolabelled cells. Local circuit neurons in mPFC displaying NADPH diaphorase activity composed less than 0.25% of the total neuron population, and were distributed in two horizontal strata, in mid- to lower layer 3 and in lower layer 5/upper layer 6. CR, PV and CB immunoreactivity was colocalised in NADPH diaphorase-reactive neurons. The interrelationships between CR+, PV+ and CB+ neurons were investigated using dual immunocytochemistry. CR+ puncta were found to be closely associated with the cell bodies and proximal processes of PV+ neurons, whereas CR+ puncta were located more distally over processes from CB+ cells. Additionally, PV+ puncta were found closely apposed to PV+ somata and processes and CR+ puncta abutted against CR+ cell bodies. The companion paper (Gabbott and Bacon [1996] J. Comp.

Since these local circuit neurons play crucial functional roles, the aim of this study was to provide supportive quantitative data defining their areal and laminar distribution in mPFC. The numerical densities of neurons (Nv, number of cells per mm3) in each area and layer were calculated stereologically. The mean total neuronal NV estimates across mPFC was 55,727 +/- 3,319 per mm3 (mean +/- S.D.; n = 3); values ranged from 50,489 +/- 8,374 per mm3 (area 24a) to 59,938 +/- 7,214 per mm3 (area 24c). Interareal differences were not significant. Cortical depth measurements and neuronal NV estimates for each area allowed the absolute number of neurons in a column of cortex under 1 mm2 of surface to be calculated; values varied between 86,457 +/- 15,063 (area 24a) and 128,464 +/- 24,050 (area 24c). Using immunolabelled Nissl-stained sections of mPFC, CR+ neurons constituted 11.2%, PV+ neurons 5.9%, and CB+ neurons 5.0% of the total neuron population. GABA+ neurons represented an overall 24.9% (23.5-27.3%) of neurons in the mPFC. Differences between areas were not significant. The cortical depth distribution histograms of CR+, PV+, CB+, and GABA+ cell populations in each area were derived and the percentage of a given cell population in each layer subsequently calculated. Peaks in the cortical depth distributions of CR+ and CB+ neurons occurred in layer 2 and upper layer 3, respectively; the peak distribution of PV+ neurons occurred between lower layer 3 and upper layer 5. The depth distribution of GABA+ cells reflected the combined distributions of CR+, PV+ and CR+ neurons. In all areas, the majority (74.4-84.0%) of the GABA cell population was located in layers 2/3. The depth distributions for each cell type were similar between areas. Diaphorase-reactive neurons accounted for 0.25% (0.2-0.32%) of all cortical neurons in mPFC and were distributed in two horizontal strata, in midlayer 3 and in mid/upper layer 6.

The calcium-binding proteins, calretinin, calbindin, and parvalbumin, are expressed in a variety of cortical local circuit neurons. However, in the primate prefrontal cortex, relatively little is known, especially with regard to calretinin, about the specific classes or distribution of local circuit neurons that contain these calcium-binding proteins. In this study, we used immunohistochemical techniques to characterize and compare the morphological features and distribution in macaque monkey prefrontal cortex of local circuit neurons that contain each of these calcium-binding proteins. On the basis of the axonal features of the labeled neurons, and correlations with previous Golgi studies, calretinin appeared to be present in double-bouquet neurons, calbindin in neurogliaform neurons and Martinotti cells, and parvalbumin in chandelier and wide arbor (basket) neurons. Calretinin was also found in other cell populations, such as a distinctive group of large neurons in the infragranular layers, but it was not possible to assign these neurons to a known cell class. In addition, although the animals studied were adults, immunoreactivity for both calretinin and calbindin was found in Cajal-Retzius neurons of layer I.

The calcium-binding proteins, calretinin, calbindin, and parvalbumin, are expressed in a variety of cortical local circuit neurons. However, in the primate prefrontal cortex, relatively little is known, especially with regard to calretinin, about the specific classes or distribution of local circuit neurons that contain these calcium-binding proteins. In this study, we used immunohistochemical techniques to characterize and compare the morphological features and distribution in macaque monkey prefrontal cortex of local circuit neurons that contain each of these calcium-binding proteins. On the basis of the axonal features of the labeled neurons, and correlations with previous Golgi studies, calretinin appeared to be present in double-bouquet neurons, calbindin in neurogliaform neurons and Martinotti cells, and parvalbumin in chandelier and wide arbor (basket) neurons. Calretinin was also found in other cell populations, such as a distinctive group of large neurons in the infragranular layers, but it was not possible to assign these neurons to a known cell class. In addition, although the animals studied were adults, immunoreactivity for both calretinin and calbindin was found in Cajal-Retzius neurons of layer I. Dual labeling studies confirmed that with the exception of the Cajal-Retzius neurons, each calcium-binding protein was expressed in separate populations of prefrontal cortical neurons.

We decided to estimate the total number of neocortical neurons in the normal human brain and to analyze it with respect to the major macro- and microscopical structural components, to study the internal relationships of these components, and to quantitate the influence of important physiological variables on brain structure. The 94 brains reported represent a consecutive collection of brains from the general Danish population. The average numbers of neocortical neurons were 19 billion in female brains and 23 billion in male brains, a 16% difference. In our study, which covered the age range from 20 years to 90 years, approximately 10% of all neocortical neurons are lost over the life span in both sexes. Sex and age were the main determinants of the total number of neurons in the human neocortex, whereas body size, per se, had no influence on neuron number. Some of the data presented have been analyzed by using new mathematical designs. An equation predicting the total neocortical neuron number in any individual in which sex and age are known is provided.",human,"84.662470, -95.852951",large_blue,1997,(Journal Article),Journal of Comparative Neurology,,,Cortico-cortical

387,"The neocortex. An overview of its evolutionary development, structural organization and synaptology","Nieuwenhuys, R.","nieuwenhuys, r.","By way of introduction, an outline is presented of the origin and evolutionary development of the neocortex. A cortical formation is lacking in amphibians, but a simple three-layered cortex is present throughout the pallium of reptiles. In mammals, two three-layered cortical structures, i.e. the prepiriform cortex and the hippocampus, are separated from each other by a six-layered neocortex. Still small in marsupials and insectivores, this ""new"" structure attains amazing dimensions in anthropoids and cetaceans. Neocortical neurons can be allocated to one of two basic categories: pyramidal and nonpyramidal cells. The pyramidal neurons form the principal elements in neocortical circuitry, accounting for at least 70% of the total neocortical population. The evolutionary development of the pyramidal neurons can be traced from simple, ""extraverted"" neurons in the amphibian pallium, via pyramid-like neurons in the reptilian cortex to the fully developed neocortical elements designated by Cajal as ""psychic cells"". Typical mammalian pyramidal neurons have the following eight features in common: (1) spiny dendrites, (2) a stout radially oriented apical dendrite, forming (3) a terminal bouquet in the most superficial cortical layer, (4) a set of basal dendrites, (5) an axon descending to the subcortical white matter, (6) a number of intracortical axon collaterals, (7) terminals establishing synaptic contacts of the round vesicle/asymmetric variety, and (8) the use of the excitatory aminoacids glutamate and/or aspartate as their neurotransmitter. The pyramidal neurons constitute the sole output and the largest input system of the neocortex. They form the principal targets of the axon collaterals of other pyramidal neurons, as well as of the endings of the main axons of cortico-cortical neurons. Indeed, the pyramidal neurons constitute together a continuous network extending over the entire neocortex, justifying the generalization: the neocortex communicates first and foremost within itself. The typical pyramidal neurons represent the end stage of a progressive evolutionary process. During further development many of these elements have become transformed by reduction into various kinds of atypical or aberrant pyramidal neurons. Interestingly, none of the six morphological characteristics, mentioned above under 1-6, has appeared to be unassailable; pyramidal neurons lacking spines, apical dendrites, long axons and intracortical axon collaterals etc. have all been described. From an evolutionary point of view the typical pyramidal neurons represent not only the principal neocortical elements, but also the source of various excitatory local circuit neurons. The spiny stellate cells, which are abundant in highly specialized primary sensory areas, form a remarkable case in point.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",unknown,"84.722584, -116.269908",large_blue,1994,(Journal Article),Anat Embryol (Berl),"Animals, Axons/ultrastructure, Cerebral Cortex/chemistry/ cytology/ultrastructure, Evolution, Humans, Immunohistochemistry, Interneurons/ultrastructure, Microcirculation, Microscopy, Electron, Nerve Fibers/ultrastructure, Neurons/chemistry/ cytology/ultrastructure, Neurons, Afferent/ultrastructure, Pyramidal Cells/ultrastructure, Synapses/ultrastructure, ","animals, axons/ultrastructure, cerebral cortex/chemistry/ cytology/ultrastructure, evolution, humans, immunohistochemistry, interneurons/ultrastructure, microcirculation, microscopy, electron, nerve fibers/ultrastructure, neurons/chemistry/ cytology/ultrastructure, neurons, afferent/ultrastructure, pyramidal cells/ultrastructure, synapses/ultrastructure, ",Cortico-cortical
388,Inter- and intra-laminar connections of pyramidal cells in the neocortex,"Bannister, Peter A.","bannister, peter a.","The flow of excitation through cortical columns has long since been predicted by studying the axonal projection patterns of excitatory neurones situated within different laminae. In grossly simplified terms and assuming random connectivity, such studies predict that input from the thalamus terminates primarily in layer 4, is relayed 'forward' to layer 3, then to layers 5 and 6 from where the modified signal may exit the cortex. Projection patterns also indicate 'back' projections from layer 5 to 3 and layer 6 to 4. More recently it has become clear that the interconnections between these layers are not random; forward projections primarily contact specific pyramidal subclasses and intracortical back projections innervate interneurones. This indicates that presynaptic axons or postsynaptic dendrites are capable of selecting their synaptic partners and that this selectivity is layer dependent. For the past decade, we and others have studied pyramidal cell targeting in circuits both within, and between laminae using paired intracellular recordings with biocytin filling and have begun to identify further levels of selectivity through the preferential targeting of electrophysiologically and/or morphologically distinct pyramidal subtypes. Presented here, therefore, is a brief overview of current thinking on the layer and subclass specific connectivity of neocortical principle excitatory cells.",mammal,"84.663447, -109.762655",large_blue,2005,(Journal Article),Neuroscience Research,"rat, primary visual cortex, ","rat, primary visual cortex, ",Cortico-cortical

Similarly, the inhibitory neurons show characteristic morphology and patterns of connections throughout the neocortex.

Our investigation shows that the primate striatum receives both direct and indirect projections from M1.

Insights into how these seemingly disparate functions may be integrated have emerged from studies that have demonstrated that the mammalian striatum is composed of two compartments arranged as a mosaic, the patches and the matrix, which differ in their neurochemical and neuroanatomical properties. In this study, projections from prefrontal, cingulate, and motor cortical areas to the striatal compartments were examined with the Phaseolus vulgaris-leucoagglutinin (PHA-L) anterograde axonal tracer in rats. Each cortical area projects to both the patches and the matrix of the striatum; however, deep layer V and layer VI corticostriatal neurons project principally to the patches, whereas superficial layer V and layer III and II corticostriatal neurons project principally to the matrix. The relative contribution of patch and matrix corticostriatal projections varies among the cortical areas examined such that allocortical areas provide a greater number of inputs to the patches than to the matrix, whereas the reverse obtains for neocortical areas.

In the present study, by using awake monkeys, the polysynaptic effects of electrical stimulation in the forelimb regions of the primary motor and primary somatosensory cortices on the activity of globus pallidus (GP) neurons, especially mediated by the subthalamic nucleus (STN), have been characterized. Cortical stimulation induced an early, short-latency excitation followed by an inhibition and a late excitation in neurons of both the external and internal segments of the GP. It also induced an early, short-latency excitation followed by a late excitation and an inhibition in STN neurons. The early excitation in STN neurons preceded that in GP neurons. Blockade of STN neuronal activity by muscimol (GABA(A) receptor agonist) injection resulted in abolishment of both the early and late excitations evoked in GP neurons by cortical stimulation. At the same time, the spontaneous discharge rate of GP neurons decreased, pauses between the groups of spikes of GP neurons became prominent, and the firing pattern became regular.

252,The parahippocampal region: corticocortico connectivity,Rebecca D. Burwell,rebecca d. burwell,"The parahippocampal region, as defined in this review, comprises the cortical regions that surround the rodent hippocampus including the perirhinal, postrhinal, and entorhinal cortices. The comparable regions in the primate brain are the perirhinal, parahippocampal, and entorhinal cortices. The perirhinal and postrhinal/parahippocampal cortices provide the major polysensory input to the hippocampus through their entorhinal connections and are the recipients of differing combinations of sensory information. The differences in the perirhinal and postrhinal cortical afferentation have important functional implications, in part, because these two regions project with different terminal patterns to the entorhinal cortex. The perirhinal cortex projects preferentially to the lateral entorhinal area (LEA), and the postrhinal cortex projects preferentially to the medial entorhinal area (MEA) and the caudal portion of LEA. Although the perirhinal and postrhinal cortices provide the major cortical input to the entorhinal cortex, the entorhinal cortex itself receives some direct cortical input. An examination of the cortical afferentation of the entorhinal cortex reveals an interesting principle of connectivity among these regions; the composition of the direct neocortical input to the LEA is more similar to that of the perirhinal cortex, and the composition of the direct neocortical input to the MEA is more similar to that of the postrhinal cortex. Thus, polymodal associational input to the LEA and the MEA exhibits some segregation and is organized in parallel. The organization of intrinsic connections for each of the parahippocampal regions also contributes to the segregation of information into parallel pathways.",primate,"79.791659, -161.406890",large_blue,2000,(Journal Article),Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences,,,Cortico-hippocampal-Cortical

These projections originate largely from infragranular layers V and VI. To examine whether the striatal and thalamic connections from the prefrontal cortex arise from separate neuronal populations or are collateralized, two different fluorescent retrograde tracers (diamidino yellow and fast blue) were injected into topographically similar regions of the head of the caudate nucleus and the mediodorsal nucleus in the same animal. The results show that although prefrontostriatal and prefrontothalamic projections arise from similar topographic regions, their laminar origins are distinctive. The connections to the head of the caudate nucleus originate mainly from layer Va, to a lesser extent from layer Vb, with a minor contribution from layers III and VI. In contrast, the projections to the mediodorsal nucleus emanate largely from layer VI, and also from layer Vb. Only occasional double-labeled neurons were observed, indicating that prefrontostriatal and prefrontothalamic connections originate from separate neuronal populations.

To gain insight into the organization of these circuits, intracortical connections of major laminar and sublaminar divisions were retrogradely labeled in Walker's area 9 and 46 in rhesus monkeys by using cholera toxin (B-subunit) conjugated to colloidal gold. Microinjections placed within particular cortical laminae produced unique patterns of retrograde labeling. Injections in layers II/III yielded labeling which was laterally widespread (2-7 mm) in supragranular layers, and more narrowly focused, i.e., conforming to a column, in layers IV-VI. In contrast, local circuits associated with layers IV and Vb displayed a regular, cylindrical organization, whereas intrinsic connections of layer Va were laterally extensive (3-5 mm) in layers III and Va. Finally, injections in layer VI gave rise to a narrow column of cell labeling traversing all layers, augmented by laterally extensive labeling (approximately 7 mm) in layer VI. The intrinsic connections of the prefrontal cortex were arrayed within mediolaterally elongated stripes which were often distributed asymmetrically in either the medial or lateral direction. In addition, labeled cells within these mediolaterally oriented fields were frequently grouped within discrete clusters or narrow bands.

G.","lavenex, p. suzuki, w. a. amaral, d. g.","We investigated the topographic and laminar organization of the efferent cortical projections of the perirhinal and parahippocampal cortices. Area 36 of the perirhinal cortex projects preferentially to areas TE and TEO, whereas area TF of the parahippocampal cortex projects preferentially to the posterior parietal cortex and area V4. Area TF projects to many regions of the frontal lobe, whereas area 36 projects mainly to the orbital surface. The insular and cingulate cortices receive projections from areas 36 and TF, whereas only area TF projects to the retrosplenial cortex. Projections to the superior temporal gyrus, including the dorsal bank of the superior temporal sulcus, arise predominantly from area TF. Area 36 projects only to rostral levels of the superior temporal gyrus. Area TF has, in general, reciprocal connections with the neocortex, whereas area 36 has more asymmetric connections. Area 36, for example, projects to more restricted regions of the frontal cortex and superior temporal sulcus than it receives inputs from. In contrast, it projects to larger portions of areas TE and TEO than it receives inputs from. The efferent projections of areas 36 and TF are primarily directed to the superficial layers of the neocortex, a laminar organization consistent with connections of the feedback type. Projections to unimodal visual areas terminate in large expanses of the cortex, but predominantly in layer I. Projections to other sensory and polymodal areas, in contrast, terminate in a columnar manner predominantly in layers II and III.

The microinjections were centered on layer V, and 42 anterogradely labeled corticofugal axons were reconstructed from serial frontal or sagittal sections with a camera lucida. Our investigation shows that the primate striatum receives both direct and indirect projections from M1. The direct corticostriatal projection is formed by axons that remain uniformly thin and unbranched throughout their sinuous trajectory to the ipsilateral striatum. They divide as they enter the dorsolateral sector of the post-commissural putamen, the so-called sensorimotor striatal territory. The indirect corticostriatal projection derives from a thin collateral emitted within the corona radiata by thick, long-range fibers that descend toward the brainstem. The collateral enters the putamen dorsomedially and remains unbranched until it reaches the dorsolateral sector of the putamen, where it breaks out into two to four axonal branches displaying small and equally spaced varicosities. Both direct and indirect corticostriatal axons branch moderately but occupy vast rostrocaudal striatal territories, where they appear to contact en passant several widely distributed striatal neurons. These findings reveal that, in contrast to current beliefs, the primate motor corticostriatal system is not exclusively formed by axons dedicated solely to the striatum.

We used three approaches to examine whether the two striatal projection neuron types (striatonigral direct pathway vs striatopallidal indirect pathway) differ in their input from IT-type and PT-type neurons. First, we retrogradely labeled one striatal projection neuron type or the other with biotinylated dextran amine (BDA)-3000 molecular weight. We found that terminals making asymmetric axospinous contact with striatonigral neurons were 0.43 microm in mean diameter, whereas those making asymmetric axospinous contact with striatopallidal neurons were 0.69 microm. Second, we preferentially immunolabeled striatonigral neurons for D1 dopamine receptors or striatopallidal neurons for D2 dopamine receptors and found that axospinous terminals had a smaller mean size (0.45 microm) on D1+ spines than on D2+ spines (0.61 microm). Finally, we combined selective BDA labeling of IT-type or PT-type terminals with immunolabeling for D1 or D2, and found that IT-type terminals were twice as common as PT-type on D1+ spines, whereas PT-type terminals were four times as common as IT-type on D2+ spines.

Reiner, A.","lei, w. jiao, y. del mar, n. reiner, a.","The two main types of corticostriatal neurons are those that project only intratelencephalically (IT-type), the intrastriatal terminals of which are 0.41 microm in mean diameter, and those that send their main axon into pyramidal tract and have a collateral projection to striatum (PT-type), the intrastriatal terminals of which are 0.82 microm in mean diameter. We used three approaches to examine whether the two striatal projection neuron types (striatonigral direct pathway vs striatopallidal indirect pathway) differ in their input from IT-type and PT-type neurons. First, we retrogradely labeled one striatal projection neuron type or the other with biotinylated dextran amine (BDA)-3000 molecular weight. We found that terminals making asymmetric axospinous contact with striatonigral neurons were 0.43 microm in mean diameter, whereas those making asymmetric axospinous contact with striatopallidal neurons were 0.69 microm. Second, we preferentially immunolabeled striatonigral neurons for D1 dopamine receptors or striatopallidal neurons for D2 dopamine receptors and found that axospinous terminals had a smaller mean size (0.45 microm) on D1+ spines than on D2+ spines (0.61 microm). Finally, we combined selective BDA labeling of IT-type or PT-type terminals with immunolabeling for D1 or D2, and found that IT-type terminals were twice as common as PT-type on D1+ spines, whereas PT-type terminals were four times as common as IT-type on D2+ spines.

F. Parent, A. Smith, Y. Bolam, J. P.","sadikot, a. f. parent, a. smith, y. bolam, j. p.","The organization of the thalamostriatal projections arising from the centromedian (CM) and parafascicular (Pf) thalamic nuclei in the squirrel monkey (Saimiri sciureus) was studied at both light and electron microscopic levels. Following selective injections of the anterograde axonal tracer Phaseolus vulgaris-leucoagglutinin (PHA-L) into the CM or Pf, patterns of terminal arborization within the striatum were compared to the biochemical heterogeneity of the striatum as revealed by immunohistochemical staining for the calcium-binding protein calbindin D-28k (CaBP), and histochemical staining for the enzymes acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate-diaphorase (NADPH-diaphorase). The PHA-L-labeled axon terminals within the striatum were further analyzed at the ultrastructural level to characterize their pattern of synaptic organization. Dense and heterogeneous terminal fields occur in the ""sensorimotor"" territory of the striatum after CM injections, or in the ""associative"" striatal territory following Pf injections. In the associative territory labeled axons arborize in a diffuse manner predominantly within areas enriched with CaBP, AChE, or NADPH-diaphorase, representing the matrix compartment, and tend to avoid areas poor in these substances, corresponding to the patch/striosome compartment. In the sensorimotor territory labeled axons form bands that occupy a subregion of the NADPH-diaphorase-rich zone in the putamen. The terminal pattern of the CM-striatal projection suggests the existence of a more complex mosaic organization within the sensorimotor territory. Ultrastructural analysis of PHA-L-labeled elements within the striatum reveals that both CM and Pf projections form asymmetric synapses upon dendrites and spines of striatal cells. A total of 339 PHA-L-labeled boutons were examined after CM injections and compared to 293 boutons following Pf injections. After CM injections, 29% of PHA-L-labeled terminals form synapses on dendritic spines and 66% on dendritic shafts, whereas after Pf injections only 12% of synapses occur on dendritic spines compared to 81% on dendritic shafts. Labeled terminals forming axosomatic or axoaxonic synapses were not seen within the striatum following either CM or Pf injections. It is concluded that in the squirrel monkey: 1) Pf-striatal fibers profusely arborize within the matrix compartment of the associative territory, 2) CM-striatal fibers form bands that occupy a subregion of the NADPH-diaphorase-rich zone within the sensorimotor territory, and 3) that both Pf- and CM-striatal projections establish asymmetric synapses with dendrites and spines of medium-sized spiny cells.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",primate,"79.314939, -131.975118",large_blue,1992,(Journal Article),J Comp Neurol,"Acetylcholinesterase/metabolism, Animals, Calcium-Binding Proteins/immunology/metabolism, Corpus Striatum/cytology/enzymology/ physiology, Efferent Pathways/cytology/ physiology, Immunohistochemistry, Microscopy, Electron, NADPH Dehydrogenase/metabolism, Phytohemagglutinins, Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't, Saimiri, Thalamic Nuclei/cytology/ physiology, ","acetylcholinesterase/metabolism, animals, calcium-binding proteins/immunology/metabolism, corpus striatum/cytology/enzymology/ physiology, efferent pathways/cytology/ physiology, immunohistochemistry, microscopy, electron, nadph dehydrogenase/metabolism, phytohemagglutinins, research support, non-u.s. gov't, saimiri, thalamic nuclei/cytology/ physiology, ",Cortico-basalGanglia-thalamo-cortical

This study explores the organization of the thalamic projections to the ventral striatum in the primate brain by means of wheat germ agglutinin conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (WGA-HRP) and Lucifer yellow (LY) retrograde tracer techniques. In addition, because functional and connective differences have been described for the core and shell components of the nucleus accumbens in the rat and are thought to be similar in the primate, this study also explores whether these regions of the nucleus accumbens can be distinguished by their thalamic input. Tracer injections are placed in different portions of the ventral striatum, including the medial and lateral regions of the ventral striatum; the central region of the ventral striatum, including the dorsal part of the core of the nucleus accumbens; and the shell region of the nucleus accumbens. Retrogradely labeled neurons are located mainly in the midline nuclear group (anterior and posterior paraventricular, paratenial, rhomboid, and reuniens thalamic nuclei) and in the parafascicular thalamic nucleus. Additional labeled cells are found in other portions of the intralaminar nuclear group as well as in other thalamic nuclei in the ventral, anterior, medial, lateral, and posterior thalamic nuclear groups. The distribution of labeled cells varies depending on the area of the ventral striatum injected. All regions of the ventral striatum receive strong projections from the midline thalamic nuclei and from the parafascicular nucleus. In addition, the medial region of the ventral striatum receives numerous projections from the central superior lateral nucleus, the magnocellular subdivision of the ventral anterior nucleus, and parts of the mediodorsal nucleus. After injection into the lateral region of the ventral striatum, few labeled neurons are seen scattered in nuclei of the intralaminar and ventral thalamic groups and occasional labeled cells in the mediodorsal nucleus. The central region of the ventral striatum, including the dorsal part of the core of the nucleus accumbens, receives a limited projection from the midline thalamic, predominantly from the rhomboid nucleus. It receives much smaller projections from the central medial nucleus and the ventral, anterior, and medial thalamic groups. The shell of the nucleus accumbens receives the most limited projection from the thalamus and is innervated almost exclusively by the midline thalamic nuclei and the central medial and parafascicular nuclei.

J.","edelstein, l. r. denaro, f. j.","The claustrum (Cl) is a subcortical structure located in the basolateral telencephalon of the mammalian brain. It has been a subject of inquiry since the mid-nineteenth century. The Cl can be identified in a number of species, and appears as a phylogenetically related nucleus in Insectivores, Prosimians and Marsupials. Ontogenetic investigations have been the subject of much debate over the years. There are three hypotheses for claustral development. To date, the ""hybrid theory"" has garnered the most support. Pathological conditions specifically associated with the Cl, while few in number, are of interest from a functional perspective. Several cases of claustral agenesis have been reported. The implications of these clinical reports are discussed. Claustral neuroanatomy at the light-microscopic and electron-microscopic level is reviewed. The morphology of the claustral neuron consists of several types, which roughly corresponds to the neuron's location within distinct claustral subdivisions. The interconnectivity of the Cl with the cerebral cortex is rather complex and reflective of complex functional interrelationships. Several researchers have investigated the angioarchitecture of the Cl. It appears that vessels permeating the insula also vascularize the Cl. Literature investigating the neurotransmitters and overall chemical neuroanatomy of the Cl is extensive. These studies clearly demonstrate that the Cl is richly innervated with a wide and diverse array of neurotransmitters and neuromodulators. Lesion, stimulation and recording experiments demonstrate that the functional and physiologic capacity of the Cl is quite robust. A recurring theme of claustral function appears to be its involvement in sensorimotor integration. This may be expected of the Cl, given the degree ofheterotopic, heterosensory convergence and its interconnectivity with the key subcortical nuclei and sensory cortical areas. The Cl remains a poorly understood and under investigated nucleus. Therefore, a review of the world literature through 1986 prior to the advent of the ""molecular revolution"" is presented. This diverse and extensive body of knowledge is reviewed in the areas ofphylogeny, ontogeny, pathology, angioarchitecture, cytochemistry, anatomy and physiology. Theories of possible claustral function are also noted. It is hoped that this work will stimulate research scientists to further investigate the functional interrelationships of the Cl as well as to aim with far greater precision and accuracy towards a deeper understanding of its raison d'etre. The recent efforts in neurosciences by Sir Francis Crick and Christof Koch implicating the Cl in visual consciousness, is an important step in understanding just what its functions could encompass. Efforts in molecular neurosciences will be indispensable for a mechanistic understanding of these functions. Currently research efforts are underway from many perspectives. In considering the past scientific literature on the Cl, it is interesting to regard that this once obscure brain structure, may serve as a model system for the study of one of the most interesting and complex brain functions-consciousness.",unknown,"78.539869, -101.970678",large_blue,2004,(Journal Article),Cell Mol Biol (Noisy-le-grand),"Animals, Basal Ganglia/ anatomy & histology/chemistry/ physiology, History, 19th Century, History, 20th Century, Humans, Neurobiology/history, Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't, Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S., ","animals, basal ganglia/ anatomy & histology/chemistry/ physiology, history, 19th century, history, 20th century, humans, neurobiology/history, research support, non-u.s. gov't, research support, u.s. gov't, p.h.s., ",Cortico-Claustral
357,Local circuit neurons of developing and mature macaque prefrontal cortex: Golgi and immunocytochemical characteristics,"Lund, J. S. Lewis, D. A.","lund, j. s. lewis, d. a.","A study has been made of the nonpyramidal, local circuit neurons in developing and mature macaque monkey prefrontal cortex with Golgi and immunocytochemical techniques. The area chosen for study is located between the cingulate gyrus and the ventral bank of the principal sulcus, and contains areas 9 and 46 as described by Walker (J. Comp. Neurol. 73:59-86, '40). In Golgi studies, the unique axonal features of impregnated neurons made possible the identification of thirteen separate classes of local circuit neurons. Five of these cell types, in their general characteristics, resembled classes identified in human prefrontal cortex, as well as in other cortical areas of macaque monkeys and other species. Measurements of the scale of axon arbors and dendritic fields of the Golgi-stained local circuit neurons also suggested particular spatial relationships of certain classes to the scale of intrinsic lattice connections made by the axons of pyramidal neurons in the same region. Similarities in morphology between cells described in human prefrontal cortex and neuron varieties described in this study indicate that this region of monkey prefrontal cortex may serve as a useful model for neuron populations in human prefrontal cortex. Sufficient morphological detail was present in immunocytochemical studies to suggest one or more identifying biochemical characteristics for seven of the thirteen classes of local circuit neurons. The calcium binding proteins, parvalbumin, calbindin D-28K, and calretinin, were found in chandelier and wide arbor neurons, neurogliaform cells, and double bouquet neurons, respectively. In addition, cholecystokinin immunoreactivity was present in medium arbor neurons and in narrow arbor cells connecting layers 2 and 4. Somatostatin 28(1-12) immunoreactivity was detected in beaded axon neurons in layers 5 and 6. This biochemical characterization of local circuit neurons, although incomplete, confirms the separate identity of at least some of the varieties distinguished by Golgi morphology, and allows a start to be made on studies examining changes in their functional state. The general inhibitory nature of these interneurons suggests that they are likely to play a crucial role in determining patterns of neural activation in the prefrontal cortex.",primate,"84.102799, -128.751797",large_blue,1993,(Journal Article),J Comp Neurol,"Animals, Axons/physiology/ultrastructure, Dendrites/ultrastructure, Immunohistochemistry, Macaca mulatta/ anatomy & histology, Neural Pathways/physiology/ultrastructure, Neurons/physiology/ultrastructure, Prefrontal Cortex/ cytology, Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S., Staining and Labeling, ","animals, axons/physiology/ultrastructure, dendrites/ultrastructure, immunohistochemistry, macaca mulatta/ anatomy & histology, neural pathways/physiology/ultrastructure, neurons/physiology/ultrastructure, prefrontal cortex/ cytology, research support, u.s. gov't, p.h.s., staining and labeling, ",Cortico-cortical

Consequently, in this study we characterized 8 different morphological types of interneurons from monkey prefrontal cortex, 4 of which have not been previously classified. These interneuron types differed in their expression of molecular markers and clustered into 3 different electrophysiological classes. The first class consisted of fast-spiking parvalbumin-positive chandelier and linear arbor cells. The second class comprised 5 different morphological types of continuous-adapting calretinin- or calbindin-positive interneurons that had the lowest level of firing threshold. However, 2 of these morphological types had short spike duration, which is not typical for rodent adapting cells. Neurogliaform cells (NGFCs), which coexpressed calbindin and neuropeptide Y, formed the third class, characterized by strong initial adaptation.

Baimbridge, K. G. Lewis, D. A.","conde, f. lund, j. s. jacobowitz, d. m. baimbridge, k. g. lewis, d. a.","In the cerebral cortex, local circuit neurons provide critical inhibitory control over the activity of pyramidal neurons, the major class of excitatory efferent cortical cells. The calcium-binding proteins, calretinin, calbindin, and parvalbumin, are expressed in a variety of cortical local circuit neurons. However, in the primate prefrontal cortex, relatively little is known, especially with regard to calretinin, about the specific classes or distribution of local circuit neurons that contain these calcium-binding proteins. In this study, we used immunohistochemical techniques to characterize and compare the morphological features and distribution in macaque monkey prefrontal cortex of local circuit neurons that contain each of these calcium-binding proteins. On the basis of the axonal features of the labeled neurons, and correlations with previous Golgi studies, calretinin appeared to be present in double-bouquet neurons, calbindin in neurogliaform neurons and Martinotti cells, and parvalbumin in chandelier and wide arbor (basket) neurons. Calretinin was also found in other cell populations, such as a distinctive group of large neurons in the infragranular layers, but it was not possible to assign these neurons to a known cell class. In addition, although the animals studied were adults, immunoreactivity for both calretinin and calbindin was found in Cajal-Retzius neurons of layer I. Dual labeling studies confirmed that with the exception of the Cajal-Retzius neurons, each calcium-binding protein was expressed in separate populations of prefrontal cortical neurons. Comparisons of the laminar distributions of the labeled neurons also indicated that these calcium-binding proteins were segregated into discrete neuronal populations. Calretinin-positive neurons were present in greatest density in deep layer I and layer II, calbindin-immunoreactive cells were most dense in layers II-superficial III, and parvalbumin-containing neurons were present in greatest density in the middle cortical layers. In addition, the relative density of calretinin-labeled neurons was approximately twice that of the calbindin- and parvalbumin-positive neurons. However, within each group of labeled neurons, their laminar distribution and relative density did not differ substantially across regions of the prefrontal cortex. These findings demonstrate that calretinin, calbindin, and parvalbumin are markers of separate populations of local circuit neurons in monkey prefrontal cortex, and that they may be useful tools in unraveling the intrinsic inhibitory circuitry of the primate prefrontal cortex in but normal and disease states.",primate,"84.423195, -125.954634",large_blue,1994,(Journal Article),J Comp Neurol,"Animals, Axons/immunology/metabolism/ultrastructure, Calcium-Binding Protein, Vitamin D-Dependent/immunology/metabolism, Calcium-Binding Proteins/immunology/ metabolism, Female, Immunohistochemistry, Macaca fascicularis, Macaca mulatta, Male, Nerve Tissue Proteins/immunology/metabolism, Neurons/immunology/ metabolism/ultrastructure, Parvalbumins/immunology/metabolism, Prefrontal Cortex/cytology/immunology/ metabolism, Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't, Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S., ","animals, axons/immunology/metabolism/ultrastructure, calcium-binding protein, vitamin d-dependent/immunology/metabolism, calcium-binding proteins/immunology/ metabolism, female, immunohistochemistry, macaca fascicularis, macaca mulatta, male, nerve tissue proteins/immunology/metabolism, neurons/immunology/ metabolism/ultrastructure, parvalbumins/immunology/metabolism, prefrontal cortex/cytology/immunology/ metabolism, research support, non-u.s. gov't, research support, u.s. gov't, p.h.s., ",Cortico-cortical

A.","lund, j. s. lewis, d. a.","A study has been made of the nonpyramidal, local circuit neurons in developing and mature macaque monkey prefrontal cortex with Golgi and immunocytochemical techniques. The area chosen for study is located between the cingulate gyrus and the ventral bank of the principal sulcus, and contains areas 9 and 46 as described by Walker (J. Comp. Neurol. 73:59-86, '40). In Golgi studies, the unique axonal features of impregnated neurons made possible the identification of thirteen separate classes of local circuit neurons. Five of these cell types, in their general characteristics, resembled classes identified in human prefrontal cortex, as well as in other cortical areas of macaque monkeys and other species. Measurements of the scale of axon arbors and dendritic fields of the Golgi-stained local circuit neurons also suggested particular spatial relationships of certain classes to the scale of intrinsic lattice connections made by the axons of pyramidal neurons in the same region. Similarities in morphology between cells described in human prefrontal cortex and neuron varieties described in this study indicate that this region of monkey prefrontal cortex may serve as a useful model for neuron populations in human prefrontal cortex. Sufficient morphological detail was present in immunocytochemical studies to suggest one or more identifying biochemical characteristics for seven of the thirteen classes of local circuit neurons. The calcium binding proteins, parvalbumin, calbindin D-28K, and calretinin, were found in chandelier and wide arbor neurons, neurogliaform cells, and double bouquet neurons, respectively. In addition, cholecystokinin immunoreactivity was present in medium arbor neurons and in narrow arbor cells connecting layers 2 and 4. Somatostatin 28(1-12) immunoreactivity was detected in beaded axon neurons in layers 5 and 6. This biochemical characterization of local circuit neurons, although incomplete, confirms the separate identity of at least some of the varieties distinguished by Golgi morphology, and allows a start to be made on studies examining changes in their functional state. The general inhibitory nature of these interneurons suggests that they are likely to play a crucial role in determining patterns of neural activation in the prefrontal cortex.",primate,"84.305095, -133.292116",large_blue,1993,(Journal Article),J Comp Neurol,"Animals, Axons/physiology/ultrastructure, Dendrites/ultrastructure, Immunohistochemistry, Macaca mulatta/ anatomy & histology, Neural Pathways/physiology/ultrastructure, Neurons/physiology/ultrastructure, Prefrontal Cortex/ cytology, Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S., Staining and Labeling, ","animals, axons/physiology/ultrastructure, dendrites/ultrastructure, immunohistochemistry, macaca mulatta/ anatomy & histology, neural pathways/physiology/ultrastructure, neurons/physiology/ultrastructure, prefrontal cortex/ cytology, research support, u.s. gov't, p.h.s., staining and labeling, ",Cortico-cortical

As expected on the basis of retrograde degeneration and transport studies, injections centered in the magnocellular (MDmc) subnucleus of MD labeled cells and terminals in the ventral and medial prefrontal cortex. Injections involving ventral MDmc labeled the more lateral of these areas (Walker's areas 11 and 12); injections of the dorsal MDmc labeled the ventromedial regions (areas 13 and 14).

Each area of prefrontal, premotor, or motor cortex injected was found to receive a topographically unique thalamic input from clusters of cells in specific subdivisions within MD. All of the prefrontal areas examined also receive topographically organized inputs from other thalamic nuclei including, most prominently, the ventral anterior (VA) and medial pulvinar nuclei. Conversely, and in agreement with previous findings, MD projects to areas of the frontal lobe beyond the traditional borders of prefrontal cortex, such as the anterior cingulate and supplementary motor cortex. The topography of thalamocortical neurons revealed in coronal sections through VA, MD, and pulvinar is circumferential. In the medial part of MD, for example, thalamocortical neurons shift from a dorsal to a ventral position for cortical targets lying medial to lateral along the ventral surface of the lobe; neurons in the lateral MD move from a ventral to a dorsal position, for cortical areas situated lateral to medial on the convexity of the hemisphere. The aggregate evidence for topographic specificity is supported further by experiments in which different fluorescent dyes were placed in multiple areas of the frontal lobe in each of three cases. The results show that very few, if any, thalamic neurons project to more than one area of cortex. The widespread cortical targets of MD neurons together with evidence for multiple thalamic inputs to prefrontal areas support a revision of the classical hodological definition of prefrontal cortex as the exclusive cortical recipient of MD projections.

In addition, there is a complex pattern of reciprocal connections with the pulvinar, which itself contains about 10 architectonically distinct subdivisions. Information flow through these corticocortical and corticothalamic circuits is regulated very dynamically by top-down as well as bottom-up processes, including directed visual attention.

G.","defelipe, j. conley, m. jones, e. g.","Small extracellular injections of HRP were placed into a stratum of corticocortical axons situated immediately deep to area 3b of the monkey somatic sensory cortex. This stratum had previously been demonstrated to contain corticocortical fibers linking the cytoarchitectonic fields of the somatic sensory cortex to one another and certain of them to the motor cortex. This method resulted in extremely successful filling of pyramidal cells, their axons, collateral axon branches, and terminations in areas 3b, 1, and 2 posterior to the injection and in areas 3a and 4 anterior to it. The major finding was that cells with somata situated in any one of these fields and with principal axons traversing the injection site have long collaterals, primarily in layers III and V, which can extend throughout their own cytoarchitectonic field and into one or more other fields. In these fields they give off focused, columnlike concentrations of terminal boutons, which can be separated from one another by 800 micron or more. The anterogradely labeled, primary corticocortical fibers, traced forwards into areas 3a and 4, have virtually identical focal terminations. These findings indicate that interareal connectivity in the sensory-motor cortex can be effected by the axon branches of single cells rather than by separate groups of cells, and this may form a basis for the convergence of place and modality information on single cells in the sensorimotor cortex, a convergence that is not seen in the thalamic input to this cortex.",primate,"82.852244, -166.846713",large_blue,1986,(Journal Article),J Neurosci,"Animals, Autoradiography, Axonal Transport, Axons/ ultrastructure, Horseradish Peroxidase, Macaca/ anatomy & histology, Macaca fascicularis/ anatomy & histology, Macaca nemestrina/ anatomy & histology, Motor Cortex/ ultrastructure, Pyramidal Tracts/ultrastructure, Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S., Somatosensory Cortex/ ultrastructure, ","animals, autoradiography, axonal transport, axons/ ultrastructure, horseradish peroxidase, macaca/ anatomy & histology, macaca fascicularis/ anatomy & histology, macaca nemestrina/ anatomy & histology, motor cortex/ ultrastructure, pyramidal tracts/ultrastructure, research support, u.s. gov't, p.h.s., somatosensory cortex/ ultrastructure, ",Cortico-cortical

The former are in upper lamina VI, have apical dendrites terminating in layer IV, and have intracortical collaterals ascending to layer IV as a narrow column about the size of a barrel. The latter are in the lower half of lamina VI, have apical dendrites terminating in layer V, and have a more extensive network of collaterals terminating in the upper part of lamina V. Corticothalamic cells do not project to distant cortical targets through branching axons. Corticocortical cells (44%) are small, short pyramids, inverted or modified pyramids, or bipolar spiny neurons.

In the monkey prefrontal cortex (PFC), horizontally oriented, intrinsic axon collaterals from supragranular pyramidal neurons form a series of stripe-like clusters of axon terminals (Levitt et al. [1993] J Comp Neurol 338:360-376; Pucak et al. [1996] J Comp Neurol 376:614-630). The present study examined the synaptic targets of the intrinsic axon collaterals arising from supragranular pyramidal neurons within the same stripe (local projections). Approximately 50% of the within-stripe axon terminals in monkey PFC area 9 targeted dendritic spines. In contrast, for both the intrinsic axon collaterals that travel between stripes (long-range projections), and the axon terminals that project to other PFC areas (associational projections), over 92% of the postsynaptic structures were dendritic spines (Melchitzky et al. [1998] J Comp Neurol 390:211-224). The other 50% of the within-stripe terminals synapsed with dendritic shafts. Dual-labeling studies confirmed that these within-stripe terminals contacted gamma-aminobutyric acid-immunoreactive dendritic shafts, including the subpopulation that contains the calcium-binding protein parvalbumin. The functional significance of the differences in synaptic targets between local and long-range intrinsic axon collaterals was supported by whole-cell, patch clamp recordings in an in vitro slice preparation of monkey PFC. Specifically, the small amplitude responses observed in layer 3 pyramidal neurons during long-range, low-intensity stimulation were exclusively excitatory, whereas local stimulation also evoked di/polysynaptic inhibitory responses. These anatomic and electrophysiological findings suggest that intrinsic connections of the PFC differ from other cortical regions and that within the PFC, feedback (within-stripe) inhibition plays a greater role in regulating the activity of supragranular pyramidal neurons than does feedforward inhibition either between stripes or across regions.",primate,"83.881068, -146.077448",large_blue,2001,(Journal Article),J Comp Neurol,"Animals, Axons/ physiology, Biotin/ analogs & derivatives, Dendrites/metabolism/ultrastructure, Dextrans, Electrophysiology, Macaca fascicularis/ physiology, Male, Microscopy, Electron, Parvalbumins/metabolism, Prefrontal Cortex/cytology/ physiology, Pyramidal Cells/ physiology/ultrastructure, Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S., Synapses/ physiology, gamma-Aminobutyric Acid/metabolism, ","animals, axons/ physiology, biotin/ analogs & derivatives, dendrites/metabolism/ultrastructure, dextrans, electrophysiology, macaca fascicularis/ physiology, male, microscopy, electron, parvalbumins/metabolism, prefrontal cortex/cytology/ physiology, pyramidal cells/ physiology/ultrastructure, research support, u.s. gov't, p.h.s., synapses/ physiology, gamma-aminobutyric acid/metabolism, ",Cortico-cortical

Pyramidal tract neurones (PTNs) were identified by antidromic activation from the cerebral peduncles or medullary pyramids. Orthodromic responses were recorded in PTNs and in other pyramidal neurones when antidromic volleys were set up by stimulation of the peduncles or pyramids. The neurones were then labelled by intracellular ionophoresis of horseradish peroxidase and their morphology examined. All neurones studied were identified as pyramidal cells according to their morphology. 2. Six pyramidal neurones located in lamina V were well stained; they included two fast PTNs and two slow PTNs. The morphology of all pyramidal neurones in this lamina (fast PTNs, slow PTNs and those pyramidal cells that were not antidromically characterized) was essentially similar. A single apical dendrite branched as it ascended and its terminals arborized subpially. Numerous lateral and oblique dendrites branched from the apical dendrites in lamina V and near its border with lamina III: short basal dendrites arborized in the vicinity of the soma in lamina V. Long basal dendrites had a wider field of arborization in lamina V and sometimes extended into lamina VI. 3. Three to five collaterals arose from the axon of lamina V cells in the cortex and arborized in laminae V and VI. Short collateral branches arborized in the vicinity of the soma in the region of the basal and lateral dendrites. Long collateral branches could be traced over long distances (often more than 1 mm). One pyramidal neurone in this lamina (a fast PTN) lacked short collateral branches from the axon. 4. Four pyramidal neurones in lamina III were stained well. The dendritic morphology of all these neurones was similar. Apical dendrites branched as they ascended and terminated subpially. Lateral and basal dendrites formed a column of dendritic branches around the soma. No long basal dendrites were seen. 5. The number and arborization of intracortical collaterals from the axon of lamina III cells varied widely; from three to twelve collaterals arose from the axon.

In the amygdala, labeled cells were observed principally in the lateral nucleus, the accessory basal nucleus, the deep or paralaminar portion of the basal nucleus, and the periamygdaloid cortex. Additional retrogradely labeled cells were found in the endopiriform nucleus, the anterior amygdaloid area, and the cortical nuclei. Retrogradely labeled cells were observed throughout much of the rostrocaudal extent of the claustrum and tended to be located in its ventral half. In the basal forebrain, retrogradely labeled cells were observed in the medial septal nucleus, the nucleus of the diagonal band, and to lesser extent within the substantia innominata. Several of the cells in the latter region were large and located within the densely packed neuronal clusters of the basal nucleus of Meynert. Most of the labeled cells in the thalamus were located in the midline nuclei. Many were found in nucleus reuniens, but even greater numbers were located in the centralis complex. Additional labeled cells were located in the paraventricular and parataenial nuclei. In all cases, numerous retrogradely labeled cells were observed in the medial pulvinar. In the hypothalamus, most of the retrogradely labeled cells were located in the supramamillary area, though scattered cells were also observed in the perifornical region and in the lateral hypothalamic area.

Both regions are characterized by structural heterogeneity, and include agranular, dysgranular and granular cortical types, denoting, respectively, the absence, incipience and presence of granular layer 4. In addition, both the prefrontal and anterior temporal cortices are composed of areas that have related though specialized functions. The pattern of cortical axonal termination was associated with both the structural type of the cortex of origin and the structure of the destination cortex. Thus, efferent fibers from a single origin in either prefrontal or anterior temporal cortex terminated in different patterns depending on their target area. Conversely, axons terminated in different patterns in a single target area, prefrontal or anterior temporal, depending on their area of origin. Projections from agranular or dysgranular type cortices (e.g. medial temporal areas and caudal orbitofrontal areas) terminated mostly in the upper layers of granular cortices (e.g. area TE and lateral prefrontal areas), and projections from granular cortices terminated mostly in the deep layers of agranular or dys- granular cortices.

In this study, we sought to test the hypothesis that pyramidal neurons in monkey prefrontal cortex that furnish callosal or ipsilateral projections have distinctive dendritic morphologies. Retrogradely-labeled, Fast Blue-containing callosal and ipsilateral neurons were intracellularly filled with Lucifer Yellow, immunoconverted, and reconstructed. Quantitative measurements of the size and complexity of the dendritic arbor, including total dendritic length, horizontal extent, number of branch points, maximum branch order, and number of segments, as well as spine density, were made. In general, callosal neurons had larger and more complex dendritic arbors for both apical and basilar dendritic trees than did ipsilateral neurons. The greatest difference was in total dendritic length; the apical and basilar trees of callosal neurons were 34 and 25% longer, respectively. In addition, spine density was also significantly greater on the apical and basilar dendrites of callosal neurons. These findings could not be explained by differences in somal size or completeness of dendritic filling between callosal and ipsilateral neurons. Our observations support the hypothesis that callosal and ipsilateral neurons differ on a number of measures of dendritic size and complexity. Furthermore, these findings imply that these two subpopulations of pyramidal cells differ in the number and perhaps types of excitatory inputs that they receive.

269,Intrinsic Connections in the macaque inferior temporal cortex,"Fujita, I. Fujita, T.","fujita, i. fujita, t.","Intrinsic connections in the inferior temporal cortex were analyzed by making extracellular injections of biocytin in Japanese macaques. Analysis was focused mainly on the dorsal part of area TE, in which a functional columnar organization has been shown. Interlaminar connections were analyzed in coronal section after laminar-specific microinjections, and intralaminar connections were examined from tangential sections. After injections at various depths in the dorsal TE, both axons and cell bodies were strongly labeled above or below the injection site in a columnar appearance. Axons from layer 3 ran in bundles towards the white matter and gave off prominent collaterals in layer 5. Ascending axons from lower to upper layers were also present (e.g., layers 4, 5, and 6 to layer 3). In tangential sections, there were abundant axons running parallel to the pia mater. These horizontal axons, particularly those in layers 2 and 3, produced patches of terminals 0.5 +/- 0.1 mm (mean +/- s.d.) in size and cylindrical in shape, spanning layers 1-3 or even to layers 4 and 5. In the tangential plane, they were distributed in an anisotropic manner around the injection. The farthest patch appeared at 4 mm from the injection site. The center-to-center distance between nearest-neighbor patches was 0.7 +/- 0.3 mm. These patches were found only within the dorsal TE and did not extend into the lower bank of the superior temporal sulcus or into the ventral part of area TE. Area TEO, which is a major afferent source to area TE, had axonal patches with spacing similar to those in area TE but with smaller sizes (0.4 +/- 0.1 mm). The results show that intrinsic horizontal axons both in area TE and in area TEO arborize in a patchy manner, as has been reported for several other cortical areas. In are TE, the size and spacing of the terminal patches match those of columns with similar stimulus selectivity. Thus, these patches may be related to the functional modularity in area TE. Vertical connections across layers and cylindrical patches of horizontal axons most likely contribute to the shared stimulus selectivity among cells within a column.",primate,"84.017040, -138.535375",large_blue,1996,(Journal Article),J Comp Neurol,"Animals, Axons/ultrastructure, Female, Lysine/analogs & derivatives, Macaca/ anatomy & histology, Male, Microinjections, Neural Pathways/anatomy & histology, Neurons/ultrastructure, Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't, Temporal Lobe/ anatomy & histology, Visual Cortex/ anatomy & histology, ","animals, axons/ultrastructure, female, lysine/analogs & derivatives, macaca/ anatomy & histology, male, microinjections, neural pathways/anatomy & histology, neurons/ultrastructure, research support, non-u.s. gov't, temporal lobe/ anatomy & histology, visual cortex/ anatomy & histology, ",Cortico-hippocampal-Cortical

In prefrontal cortex (areas 9 and 46), stripe-like connectivity patterns are observed. In all areas of cortex examined, the width of the terminal-free gaps is closely scaled to the average diameter of terminal patches, or width of terminal stripes. In addition, both patch and gap dimensions match the average lateral spread of the dendritic field of single pyramidal neurons in the superficial layers of the same cortical region. These architectural features of the connectional mosaics are constant despite a twofold difference in scale across cortical areas and different species. They therefore appear to be fundamental features of cortical organization.

59,Single-axon tracing study of corticostriatal projections arising from primary motor cortex in primates,"Parent, M. Parent, A.","parent, m. parent, a.","The axonal projections arising from the forelimb area of the primary motor cortex (M1) in cynomolgus monkeys (Macaca fascicularis) were studied following microiontophoretic injections of biotinylated dextran amine under electrophysiological guidance. The microinjections were centered on layer V, and 42 anterogradely labeled corticofugal axons were reconstructed from serial frontal or sagittal sections with a camera lucida. Our investigation shows that the primate striatum receives both direct and indirect projections from M1. The direct corticostriatal projection is formed by axons that remain uniformly thin and unbranched throughout their sinuous trajectory to the ipsilateral striatum. They divide as they enter the dorsolateral sector of the post-commissural putamen, the so-called sensorimotor striatal territory. The indirect corticostriatal projection derives from a thin collateral emitted within the corona radiata by thick, long-range fibers that descend toward the brainstem. The collateral enters the putamen dorsomedially and remains unbranched until it reaches the dorsolateral sector of the putamen, where it breaks out into two to four axonal branches displaying small and equally spaced varicosities. Both direct and indirect corticostriatal axons branch moderately but occupy vast rostrocaudal striatal territories, where they appear to contact en passant several widely distributed striatal neurons. These findings reveal that, in contrast to current beliefs, the primate motor corticostriatal system is not exclusively formed by axons dedicated solely to the striatum. It also comprises collaterals from long-range corticofugal axons, which can thus provide to the striatum a copy of the neural information that is being conveyed to the brainstem and/or spinal cord.",primate,"78.223558, -112.535017",large_blue,2006,(Journal Article),J Comp Neurol,"Afferent Pathways/ anatomy & histology/metabolism, Animals, Axons/metabolism/ physiology, Biotin/analogs & derivatives/pharmacokinetics, Comparative Study, Corpus Striatum/ cytology/metabolism, Dextrans/pharmacokinetics, Electron Transport Complex IV/ metabolism, Female, Macaca fascicularis, Male, Motor Cortex/ cytology, Neurons/ cytology/physiology, ","afferent pathways/ anatomy & histology/metabolism, animals, axons/metabolism/ physiology, biotin/analogs & derivatives/pharmacokinetics, comparative study, corpus striatum/ cytology/metabolism, dextrans/pharmacokinetics, electron transport complex iv/ metabolism, female, macaca fascicularis, male, motor cortex/ cytology, neurons/ cytology/physiology, ",Cortico-pontine

One type, the 'patch' compartment, is identified by patches of dense opiate receptor binding, and is enriched in enkephalin- and substance P-like immunoreactivity. The other compartment, the 'matrix', has a high acetylcholinesterase activity, and is shown here to have a dense plexus of fibres displaying somatostatin-like immunoreactivity. The present study demonstrates the two compartments have distinct connections, using a method that concurrently reveals striatal input, output and neurochemical systems in the rat. Patches receive inputs from the prelimbic cortex (a medial frontal cortical area with direct 'limbic' inputs from the amygdala and hippocampus); they also project to the substantia nigra pars compacta (the source of the nigrostriatal dopaminergic system). Conversely, the matrix receives inputs from sensory and motor cortical areas; here it is shown to project to the substantia nigra pars reticulata (the source of the non-dopaminergic nigrothalamic and nigrotectal system). Also, an intrinsic striatal somatostatin-immunoreactive system is described that may provide a link between the two compartments.

57,The neostriatal mosaic: striatal patch-matrix organization is related to cortical lamination,"Gerfen, C. R.","gerfen, c. r.","The basal ganglia, of which the striatum is the major component, process inputs from virtually all cerebral cortical areas to affect motor, emotional, and cognitive behaviors. Insights into how these seemingly disparate functions may be integrated have emerged from studies that have demonstrated that the mammalian striatum is composed of two compartments arranged as a mosaic, the patches and the matrix, which differ in their neurochemical and neuroanatomical properties. In this study, projections from prefrontal, cingulate, and motor cortical areas to the striatal compartments were examined with the Phaseolus vulgaris-leucoagglutinin (PHA-L) anterograde axonal tracer in rats.

56,Comparing the function of the corticospinal system in different species: organizational differences for motor specialization?,"Lemon, R. N. Griffiths, J.","lemon, r. n. griffiths, j.","An appreciation of the comparative functions of the corticospinal tract is of direct relevance to the understanding of how results from animal models can advance knowledge of the human motor system and its disorders. Two critical functions of the corticospinal tract are discussed: first, the role of descending projections to the dorsal horn in the control of sensory afferent input, and second, the capacity of direct cortico-motoneuronal projections to support voluntary execution of skilled hand and finger movements. We stress that there are some important differences in corticospinal projections from different cortical regions within a particular species and that these projections support different functions. Therefore, any differences in the organization of corticospinal projections across species may well reflect differences in their functional roles. Such differences most likely reflect features of the sensorimotor behavior that are characteristic of that species. Insights into corticospinal function in different animal models are of direct relevance to understanding the human motor system, providing they are interpreted in relation to the functions they underpin in a given model. Studies in non-human primates will continue to be needed for understanding special features of the human motor system, including feed-forward control of skilled hand movements.

Single small injections of the enzyme were made in the different intralaminar nuclei--mediodorsal, ventromedial, midline, and habenular--and in anterior group nuclei. The location and density of the neuronal labeling in the different parts of the RT were studied in each case. Our results show that 1) after injections located in all the nuclei here studied, a consistent number of labeled neurons were found in the RT, except for the injections in the lateral habenula and the anterior thalamic nuclear complex, both of which did not label neurons in the RT. 2) Among the other thalamic nuclei here studied, the most medially situated receive less numerous RT projections than those most laterally located. 3) Injections in all the nuclei studied gave rise to a cellular labeling in the anterior sectors of the RT, except for the anterior nuclear group and the lateral habenula. The projections from the rostral pole of the RT were topographically mediolaterally organized. 4) The anterodorsal part of the pregeniculate sector of the RT projects upon the large-celled part of the lateral central nucleus and to a lesser extent upon the paracentral, centromedian, and ventromedial nuclei, the anterior part of the lateral central nucleus, and the lateral band of the mediodorsal nucleus.

A series of adjacent coronal sections taken at three comparable rostrocaudal levels in the three species were treated to reveal the three neuronal markers and the density of each type of chemospecific interneurons was analyzed with a computerized image analysis system. In primates, the most abundant interneurons were those expressing CR. The ratio of CR+/PV+ neurons was approximately 2-3:1 compared to a ratio of 3-4:1 for CR+/NADPH-d+ neurons. In contrast, the most frequently encountered interneurons in the rat striatum were those expressing PV. In rodents, all three interneurons were more abundant rostrally than caudally, but CR+ neurons displayed a particularly striking rostrocaudal decreasing gradient. In monkeys and humans, the three striatal interneurons were distributed rather uniformly rostrocaudally, but CR+ and PV+ interneurons were significantly more numerous in the caudate nucleus than in the putamen in humans. In monkeys, only PV+ neurons were more abundant in the caudate nucleus than in putamen. Overall, the density of the three striatal interneurons was much higher in monkeys than in rats and humans.

All eight reconstructed tyrosine hydroxylase-positive dopaminergic neurons possessed widely spread and highly dense axonal arborizations in the neostriatum. All of them emitted very little axon collateral arborization outside of the striatum except for tiny arborization in the external pallidum. The striatal axonal bush of each reconstructed dopaminergic neuron covered 0.45-5.7% (mean +/- SD = 2.7 +/- 1.5%) of the total volume of the neostriatum. Furthermore, all the dopaminergic neurons innervated both striosome and matrix compartments of the neostriatum, although each neuron's arborization tended to favor one of these compartments. Our findings demonstrate that individual dopaminergic neurons of the substantia nigra can broadcast a dopamine signal and exert strong influence over a large number of striatal neurons. This divergent signaling should be a key to the function of the nigrostriatal system in dopamine-based learning and suggests that neurodegeneration of individual nigral neurons can affect multiple neurons in the striatum.

118,Prefrontal projections to the thalamic reticular nucleus form a unique circuit for attentional mechanisms,"Zikopoulos, B. Barbas, H.","zikopoulos, b. barbas, h.","The inhibitory thalamic reticular nucleus (TRN) intercepts and modulates all corticothalamic and thalamocortical communications. Previous studies showed that projections from sensory and motor cortices originate in layer VI and terminate as small boutons in central and caudal TRN. Here we show that prefrontal projections to TRN in rhesus monkeys have a different topographic organization and mode of termination. Prefrontal cortices projected mainly to the anterior TRN, at sites connected with the mediodorsal, ventral anterior, and anterior medial thalamic nuclei. However, projections from areas 46, 13, and 9 terminated widely in TRN and colocalized caudally with projections from temporal auditory, visual, and polymodal association cortices. Population analysis and serial EM reconstruction revealed two distinct classes of corticoreticular terminals synapsing with GABA/parvalbumin-positive dendritic shafts of TRN neurons. Most labeled boutons from prefrontal axons were small, but a second class of large boutons was also prominent. This is in contrast to the homogeneous small TRN terminations from sensory cortices noted previously and in the present study, which are thought to arise exclusively from layer VI. The two bouton types were often observed on the same axon, suggesting that both prefrontal layers V and VI could project to TRN. The dual mode of termination suggests a more complex role of prefrontal input in the functional regulation of TRN and gating of thalamic output back to the cortex. The targeting of sensory tiers of TRN by specific prefrontal areas may underlie attentional regulation for the selection of relevant sensory signals and suppression of distractors.",primate,"79.429923, -148.205103",large_blue,2006,(Journal Article),J Neurosci,"Animals, Attention, Auditory Pathways, Axons/physiology/ultrastructure, Image Processing, Computer-Assisted, Immunohistochemistry, Macaca mulatta, Magnetic Resonance Imaging, Mediodorsal Thalamic Nucleus/physiology/ultrastructure, Prefrontal Cortex/ physiology, Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural, Synapses/physiology/ultrastructure, Thalamic Nuclei/anatomy & histology/ physiology/ultrastructure, Ventral Thalamic Nuclei/physiology/ultrastructure, Visual Pathways, ","animals, attention, auditory pathways, axons/physiology/ultrastructure, image processing, computer-assisted, immunohistochemistry, macaca mulatta, magnetic resonance imaging, mediodorsal thalamic nucleus/physiology/ultrastructure, prefrontal cortex/ physiology, research support, n.i.h., extramural, synapses/physiology/ultrastructure, thalamic nuclei/anatomy & histology/ physiology/ultrastructure, ventral thalamic nuclei/physiology/ultrastructure, visual pathways, ",Cortico-basalGanglia-thalamo-cortical

The classical cytoarchitectural areas of the neocortex are composed of smaller units, local neural circuits repeated iteratively within each area. Modules may vary in cell type and number, in internal and external connectivity, and in mode of neuronal processing between different large entities; within any single large entity they have a basic similarity of internal design and operation. Modules are most commonly grouped into entities by sets of dominating external connections. This unifying factor is most obvious for the heterotypical sensory and motor areas of the neocortex. Columnar defining factors in homotypical areas are generated, in part, within the cortex itself. The set of all modules composing such an entity may be fractionated into different modular subsets by different extrinsic connections. Linkages between them and subsets in other large entities form distributed systems. The neighborhood relations between connected subsets of modules in different entities result in nested distributed systems that serve distributed functions. A cortical area defined in classical cytoarchitectural terms may belong to more than one and sometimes to several distributed systems.

Clear patterns are emerging from these studies, with 'forward' projections from layer 4 to 3 and from 3 to 5 targeting both selected pyramidal cells and interneurons, while 'back' projections from layer 5 to 3 and from 3 to 4 target only interneurons.

Large injections of CTb involving both pallidal segments produce numerous retrogradely labeled neurons in the substantia nigra (SN), the pedunculopontine tegmental nucleus (PPN) and the dorsal raphe nucleus (DR). Labeled neurons are distributed uniformly in SN with a slight numerical increase at the junction between the pars compacta (SNc) and the ventral tegmental area (VTA). Retrogradely labeled neurons abound also in PPN, principally in its pars dissipata, whereas other CTb-labeled cells are scattered throughout the rostrocaudal extent of DR. After CTb injection involving specifically the internal pallidal segment (GPi), the same pattern of cell distribution is found in SN, PPN and DR, except that the number of retrogradely labeled cells is lower than after large pallidal complex injections. Approximately 70% of all CTb-labeled neurons in SNc-VTA complex display TH immunoreactivity, whereas 20% are immunoreactive for CaBP. About 39% of all retrogradely labeled neurons in PPN are immunoreactive for ChAT, whereas approximately 38% of the labeled neurons in DR display 5-HT immunoreactivity. Following CTb injection in the external pallidal segment (GPe), the number of labeled cells is much smaller than after GPi injection. The majority of CTb-labeled cells in SNc-VTA complex are located in the lateral half of SNc and approximately 93% of these neurons display TH immunoreactivity compared to 10% that are immunoreactive for CaBP; very few CTb-labeled cells occur in PPN. Retrogradely labeled cells in DR are located more laterally than those that projects to the GPi and about 25% of them are immunoreactive for 5-HT.

Here, neurons located in either striosomes or the extrastriosomal matrix in squirrel monkeys were injected with biotin dextran amine, and their labeled axons were entirely reconstructed with a camera lucida. Twenty-four of 27 reconstructed axons arborized into the three main striatal targets (external pallidum, globus pallidus, and substantia nigra pars reticulata), a finding that is at odds with the concept of a dual striatofugal system. Axons of striosomal neurons formed several columnar terminal fields in the substantia nigra pars reticulata.

These terminal fields were variable in size and comprised 4-43 very thin, varicose branches. They consisted either of different axonal branches of the same axon or of different axons and covered 10-31 thalamic cell bodies.

Two striatal projection systems--so-called direct and indirect pathways--form the functional backbone of the basal ganglia circuit.

Although this hypothesis sparked a debate, the evidence that has accumulated since then clearly supports this model. Recent advances in the means of marking neural circuits with optical or molecular reporters have revealed a clear-cut dichotomy between these two cell types at the molecular, anatomical, and physiological levels.

Parent, A.","parent, m. parent, a.","The axonal projections from the centre median (CM)/parafascicular (Pf) thalamic complex in squirrel monkeys were studied after microiontophoretic injections of biotinylated dextran amine under electrophysiological guidance. A total of 29 axons connected to their parent cell body were entirely reconstructed from serial sections with a camera lucida. Our investigation shows that the CM and Pf nuclei in primates comprise three types of projection neurons: (1) neurons that innervate densely and focally the striatum; (2) neurons that arborize diffusely in the cerebral cortex; and (3) neurons that innervate both striatum and cerebral cortex. Striatal innervation of CM origin consists of dense clusters of axon terminals exhibiting pedunculated varicosities and forming oblique bands in the dorsolateral sector of putamen (sensorimotor striatal territory). The same type of striatal innervation occurs in the head of caudate nucleus (associative striatal territory) in cases of Pf-labeled neurons. The CM neurons that target cerebral cortex arborize principally in motor and premotor areas, whereas Pf neurons innervate chiefly prefrontal areas. Cortical innervation from both nuclei is much more profuse in layers V and VI than in layer I. Our three-dimensional reconstruction studies show that dendritic and axonal arborizations of CM neurons extend essentially along the sagittal plane. These results revealed that, in contrast to rodents where virtually all Pf neurons project to both striatum and cortex, the primate CM/Pf complex harbors several types of highly patterned projection neurons.

The mouse cortex displays a number of other features that distinguish it from the cortex of primates and suggest a somewhat less complex pattern of organization. Nevertheless, dramatic findings on the origins and migratory patterns of newly specified GABAergic cortical interneurons in the embryonic mouse have led to a prevailing view that GABAergic cortical interneurons of all species are born in the ganglionic eminence and undergo the same long tangential migration toward the cortex that is seen in the mouse. Recent observations in fetal human and monkey brains, although clearly identifying GABAergic neurons that reach the neocortex via the tangential route, also demonstrate that substantial numbers of GABA neurons are generated in the lateral ventricular neuroepithelium and migrate into the cortex via the same radial route followed by glutamatergic neurons. In the course of evolution of the higher primate cortex, it is likely that new forms of cortical interneuron with origins in the ventricular neuroepithelium have been added to an older population derived from the ganglionic eminence.",unknown,"84.662473, -103.716147",large_blue,2009,(Journal Article),Cereb Cortex,"Animals, Biological Evolution, Cerebral Cortex/cytology/ physiology, Haplorhini/ genetics, Humans/ genetics, Interneurons/cytology/ physiology, Mice/ genetics, Species Specificity, ","animals, biological evolution, cerebral cortex/cytology/ physiology, haplorhini/ genetics, humans/ genetics, interneurons/cytology/ physiology, mice/ genetics, species specificity, ",Cortico-cortical

The primate GPi is composed of a majority of neurons endowed with a highly collateralized axon that projects to the premotor neurons located in the ventral tier thalamic nuclei, the center-median/parafascicular thalamic complex and the brainstem pedunculopontine nucleus. These axons often follow a long and tortuous course within the GPi and then emerge either through the ansa lenticularis (AL) or the lenticular fasciculus (LF), irrespective of the location of their parent cell body in the GPi. Other pallidofugal axons exit through the medial pole of the GPi, at various distances between the AL ventrally and the LF dorsally. Virtually all pallidofugal axons course through Forel's field H, on their way to the thalamus and brainstem. They emit numerous short collaterals and boutons en passant in this sector of the subthalamic region, which stands out as a major target of GPi axons. Our results indicate that AL and LF do not form separate anatomical entities, each carrying axons originating from distinct functional pallidal territories, as commonly believed. Instead, these two fascicles form the ventral and dorsal borders of a morphological continuum that harbors a multitude of pallidofugal axons arising from all sectors of the GPi.

These aims were achieved by injections of the retrograde-anterograde tracer, biotinylated dextran amine (BDA), in different functional regions of the internal pallidum (GPi) in squirrel monkeys. The location of retrogradely labelled cells in the striatum was determined to ascertain the functional specificity of the injection sites. Injections in the ventrolateral two-thirds of the GPi (group 1) led to retrograde labelling in the postcommissural region of the putamen (""sensorimotor striatum"") and plexuses of labelled fibers in the rostral one-third of the principal ventrolateral nucleus (VLp) and the central part of the CM. On the other hand, injections in the dorsal one-third (group 3) and the rostromedial pole (group 4) of the GPi led to retrogradely labelled cells in the body of the caudate nucleus (""associative striatum"") and the ventral striatum (""limbic striatum""), respectively. After those injections, dense plexuses of anterogradely labelled varicosities were found in common thalamic nuclei, including the parvocellular ventral anterior nucleus (VApc), the dorsal VL (VLd), and the rostrodorsal part of the parafascicular nucleus (PF).

These findings demonstrate that the overall morphological organization of individual nigral axons is complex and allows single axons to influence thalamic neurons via a combination of divergent, convergent, and amplification processes.",primate,"77.588169, -144.483484",large_blue,2002,(Journal Article),J Comp Neurol,"Animals, Biotin/ analogs & derivatives/diagnostic use, Cell Size/physiology, Cercopithecus aethiops/ anatomy & histology/physiology, Dextrans/diagnostic use, Fluorescent Dyes/diagnostic use, Macaca fascicularis/ anatomy & histology/physiology, Male, Neural Pathways/ cytology/physiology, Presynaptic Terminals/physiology/ ultrastructure, Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't, Substantia Nigra/ cytology/physiology, Thalamus/ cytology/physiology, ","animals, biotin/ analogs & derivatives/diagnostic use, cell size/physiology, cercopithecus aethiops/ anatomy & histology/physiology, dextrans/diagnostic use, fluorescent dyes/diagnostic use, macaca fascicularis/ anatomy & histology/physiology, male, neural pathways/ cytology/physiology, presynaptic terminals/physiology/ ultrastructure, research support, non-u.s. gov't, substantia nigra/ cytology/physiology, thalamus/ cytology/physiology, ",L1-Cortical
43,Two types of projection neurons in the internal pallidum of primates: single-axon tracing and three-dimensional reconstruction,"Parent, M. Levesque, M. Parent, A.","parent, m. levesque, m. parent, a.","The axonal projections of the internal pallidum (GPi) in cynomolgus monkeys (Macaca fascicularis) were studied by labeling small pools of neurons with biotinylated dextran amine. Fifty-two axons were reconstructed entirely from serial sections with a camera lucida. Two types of projection neurons were identified in the GPi on the basis of their target sites. The abundant and centrally located type I neurons gave rise to a long axonal branch that descended directly to the pedunculopontine tegmental nucleus, where it arborized discretely. Other branches ascended to the thalamus and broke into 10-15 thinner collaterals that ran through most of the ventral anterior nucleus, where they terminated as typical plexuses. About half of these axons gave rise to collaterals that arborized in both components of the centre médian/parafascicular thalamic complex. The less numerous and peripherally located type II neurons had an axon that climbed the rostral thalamic pole, coursed along the stria medullaris, and arborized profusely within the lateral habenular nucleus, which stood out as the most densely innervated pallidal target. Some type II axons provided collaterals to the anterior thalamic nuclei. A small proportion of axons of both types had branches that crossed the midline and terminated in contralateral GPi target structures. Three-dimensional reconstruction showed that type I axons arborized principally along the sagittal plane. These data reveal that GPi neurons of type I act through a widely distributed axonal network upon thalamic and brainstem premotor neurons, whereas type II neurons act in a much more focused manner upon lateral habenular neurons.",primate,"77.506823, -143.781315",large_blue,2001,(Journal Article),J Comp Neurol,"Action Potentials/ physiology, Amidines/pharmacokinetics, Animals, Axons/physiology/ ultrastructure, Biotin/ analogs & derivatives/pharmacokinetics, Calcium-Binding Protein, Vitamin D-Dependent/metabolism, Cell Size/physiology, Dendrites/physiology/ ultrastructure, Dextrans/pharmacokinetics, Efferent Pathways/ cytology/physiology, Electron Transport Complex IV/metabolism, Female, Fluorescent Dyes/pharmacokinetics, Globus Pallidus/ cytology/physiology, Habenula/cytology/physiology, Image Processing, Computer-Assisted, Immunohistochemistry, Intralaminar Thalamic Nuclei/cytology/physiology, Macaca fascicularis/ anatomy & histology/physiology, Male, Molecular Probes/pharmacokinetics, Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't, Tegmentum Mesencephali/cytology/physiology, Ventral Thalamic Nuclei/cytology/physiology, ","action potentials/ physiology, amidines/pharmacokinetics, animals, axons/physiology/ ultrastructure, biotin/ analogs & derivatives/pharmacokinetics, calcium-binding protein, vitamin d-dependent/metabolism, cell size/physiology, dendrites/physiology/ ultrastructure, dextrans/pharmacokinetics, efferent pathways/ cytology/physiology, electron transport complex iv/metabolism, female, fluorescent dyes/pharmacokinetics, globus pallidus/ cytology/physiology, habenula/cytology/physiology, image processing, computer-assisted, immunohistochemistry, intralaminar thalamic nuclei/cytology/physiology, macaca fascicularis/ anatomy & histology/physiology, male, molecular probes/pharmacokinetics, research support, non-u.s. gov't, tegmentum mesencephali/cytology/physiology, ventral thalamic nuclei/cytology/physiology, ",L1-Cortical

41,Efferent connections of the internal globus pallidus in the squirrel monkey: I. Topography and synaptic organization of the pallidothalamic projection,"Sidibe, M. Bevan, M. D. Bolam, J. P. Smith, Y.","sidibe, m. bevan, m. d. bolam, j. p. smith, y.","The objectives of this study were, on one hand, to better understand how the segregated functional pathways from the cerebral cortex through the striatopallidal complex emerged in the projections to the thalamus and, on the other hand, to compare the ultrastructure and synaptic organization of the pallidal efferents to the ventrolateral (VL) and centromedian (CM) thalamic nuclei in primates. These aims were achieved by injections of the retrograde-anterograde tracer, biotinylated dextran amine (BDA), in different functional regions of the internal pallidum (GPi) in squirrel monkeys. The location of retrogradely labelled cells in the striatum was determined to ascertain the functional specificity of the injection sites. Injections in the ventrolateral two-thirds of the GPi (group 1) led to retrograde labelling in the postcommissural region of the putamen (""sensorimotor striatum"") and plexuses of labelled fibers in the rostral one-third of the principal ventrolateral nucleus (VLp) and the central part of the CM. On the other hand, injections in the dorsal one-third (group 3) and the rostromedial pole (group 4) of the GPi led to retrogradely labelled cells in the body of the caudate nucleus (""associative striatum"") and the ventral striatum (""limbic striatum""), respectively. After those injections, dense plexuses of anterogradely labelled varicosities were found in common thalamic nuclei, including the parvocellular ventral anterior nucleus (VApc), the dorsal VL (VLd), and the rostrodorsal part of the parafascicular nucleus (PF). In the caudal two-thirds of the CM/PF, the labelled fibers formed a band that lay along the dorsal border of the complex in a region called the dorsolateral PF (PFdl) in this study. The ventromedial nucleus (VM) was densely labelled only after injections in the rostromedial GPi, whereas the dorsal part of the zona incerta was labelled in both groups. At the electron microscopic level, the BDA-positive terminals in the VLp were larger and more elongated than those in the CM but, overall, displayed the same pattern of synaptic organization. Our findings indicate 1) that some associative and limbic cortical information, which is largely processed in segregated corticostriatopallidal channels, converges to common thalamic nuclei and 2) that the PF is a major target of associative and limbic GPi efferents in monkeys.",primate,"77.672691, -144.590681",large_blue,1997,(Journal Article),J Comp Neurol,"Animals, Biotin/analogs & derivatives, Brain Mapping/ methods, Cerebral Cortex/physiology, Dextrans, Efferent Pathways/physiology/ultrastructure, Fluorescent Dyes, Globus Pallidus/ physiology/ultrastructure, Male, Microscopy, Electron, Neurons/physiology, Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't, Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S., Saimiri/anatomy & histology/ physiology, Synapses/ physiology/ultrastructure, Terminology, Thalamic Nuclei/ physiology/ultrastructure, ","animals, biotin/analogs & derivatives, brain mapping/ methods, cerebral cortex/physiology, dextrans, efferent pathways/physiology/ultrastructure, fluorescent dyes, globus pallidus/ physiology/ultrastructure, male, microscopy, electron, neurons/physiology, research support, non-u.s. gov't, research support, u.s. gov't, p.h.s., saimiri/anatomy & histology/ physiology, synapses/ physiology/ultrastructure, terminology, thalamic nuclei/ physiology/ultrastructure, ",L1-Cortical
5,Dendritic morphology of callosal and ipsilateral projection neurons in monkey prefrontal cortex,"Soloway, A. S. Pucak, M. L. Melchitzky, D. S. Lewis, D. A.","soloway, a. s. pucak, m. l. melchitzky, d. s. lewis, d. a.","Subpopulations of cortical pyramidal neurons have been distinguished based on the projection target of their principal axons or by their dendritic morphology. In this study, we sought to test the hypothesis that pyramidal neurons in monkey prefrontal cortex that furnish callosal or ipsilateral projections have distinctive dendritic morphologies. Retrogradely-labeled, Fast Blue-containing callosal and ipsilateral neurons were intracellularly filled with Lucifer Yellow, immunoconverted, and reconstructed. Quantitative measurements of the size and complexity of the dendritic arbor, including total dendritic length, horizontal extent, number of branch points, maximum branch order, and number of segments, as well as spine density, were made. In general, callosal neurons had larger and more complex dendritic arbors for both apical and basilar dendritic trees than did ipsilateral neurons. The greatest difference was in total dendritic length; the apical and basilar trees of callosal neurons were 34 and 25% longer, respectively. In addition, spine density was also significantly greater on the apical and basilar dendrites of callosal neurons. These findings could not be explained by differences in somal size or completeness of dendritic filling between callosal and ipsilateral neurons. Our observations support the hypothesis that callosal and ipsilateral neurons differ on a number of measures of dendritic size and complexity. Furthermore, these findings imply that these two subpopulations of pyramidal cells differ in the number and perhaps types of excitatory inputs that they receive. Finally, differences in the dendritic morphology of callosal and ipsilateral neurons have implications for understanding the functional attributes of these two populations of cells, as well as for the characterization of pyramidal neurons in human disease states.",primate,"81.200446, -100.908309",large_blue,2002,(Journal Article),Neuroscience,"Amidines/diagnostic use, Animals, Cell Size/physiology, Corpus Callosum/ cytology/physiology, Dendrites/physiology/ ultrastructure, Fluorescent Dyes/diagnostic use, Immunohistochemistry, Isoquinolines/diagnostic use, Laterality/ physiology, Macaca fascicularis/ anatomy & histology/physiology, Male, Neural Pathways/ cytology/physiology, Prefrontal Cortex/ cytology/physiology, Pyramidal Cells/ cytology/physiology, Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S., ","amidines/diagnostic use, animals, cell size/physiology, corpus callosum/ cytology/physiology, dendrites/physiology/ ultrastructure, fluorescent dyes/diagnostic use, immunohistochemistry, isoquinolines/diagnostic use, laterality/ physiology, macaca fascicularis/ anatomy & histology/physiology, male, neural pathways/ cytology/physiology, prefrontal cortex/ cytology/physiology, pyramidal cells/ cytology/physiology, research support, u.s. gov't, p.h.s., ",Cortico-Claustral
