The goal of the present study was to assess whether the claustral projections to distinct areas within the frontal cortex arise from separate regions within the claustrum. Multiple injections of tracers were performed in 15 macaque monkeys, aimed toward primary motor area (M1), pre-supplementary motor area (pre-SMA), SMA-proper, rostral (PMd-r) and caudal (PMd-c) parts of the dorsal premotor cortex (PM), rostral (PMv-r) and caudal (PMv-c) parts of the ventral PM, and superior and inferior parts of area 46. The distribution of retrogradely labeled neurons showed no clear segregation along the rostrocaudal axis of the claustrum; they were usually located along the entire anteroposterior extent of the claustrum. For all motor cortical areas, there was a general trend of the labeled neurons to occupy the dorsal and intermediate parts of the claustrum along the dorsoventral axis. The same territories were labeled after injection in area 46, but in addition numerous labeled neurons were found in the most ventral part of the claustrum. At higher resolution, however, there was clear evidence that the territories projecting to pre-SMA and SMA-proper formed separate, interdigitating, clusters along the dorsoventral axis. A comparable local segregation was observed for the two subdivisions of area 46, whereas there was more local overlap among the subareas of PM. The projections from the claustrum to the multiple subareas of the motor cortex and to area 46 arise from largely overlapping territories, with, however, some degree of local segregation.",

            "The claustrum is interconnected with the frontal lobe, including the motor cortex, prefrontal cortex, and cingulate cortex. The goal of the present study was to assess whether the claustral projections to distinct areas within the frontal cortex arise from separate regions within the claustrum. Multiple injections of tracers were performed in 15 macaque monkeys, aimed toward primary motor area (M1), pre-supplementary motor area (pre-SMA), SMA-proper, rostral (PMd-r) and caudal (PMd-c) parts of the dorsal premotor cortex (PM), rostral (PMv-r) and caudal (PMv-c) parts of the ventral PM, and superior and inferior parts of area 46. The distribution of retrogradely labeled neurons showed no clear segregation along the rostrocaudal axis of the claustrum; they were usually located along the entire anteroposterior extent of the claustrum. For all motor cortical areas, there was a general trend of the labeled neurons to occupy the dorsal and intermediate parts of the claustrum along the dorsoventral axis. The same territories were labeled after injection in area 46, but in addition numerous labeled neurons were found in the most ventral part of the claustrum. At higher resolution, however, there was clear evidence that the territories projecting to pre-SMA and SMA-proper formed separate, interdigitating, clusters along the dorsoventral axis. A comparable local segregation was observed for the two subdivisions of area 46, whereas there was more local overlap among the subareas of PM. The projections from the claustrum to the multiple subareas of the motor cortex and to area 46 arise from largely overlapping territories, with, however, some degree of local segregation."

It receives a convergent retinotopic projection from several visual cortical ares, including areas 17, 18, 19, 21a and PMLS (posteromedial lateral suprasylvian area). The projection arises from spiny dendrite cells (pyramidal and fusiform) in the middle of cortical layer VI. As shown by a double label experiment, they form a separate population from those projecting to the lateral geniculate nucleus. There are also inputs from the lateral hypothalamus, from the nucleus centralis thalami, and probably from the locus coeruleus, but not from the sensory nuclei of the thalamus. Non-visual cortical areas do not project to the visual claustrum, but many of them are connected to other parts of the nucleus. For example, the splenial (cingulate) gyrus projects to a claustral zone just ventral to the visual area, and regions anterior to the visual area are connected with somatosensory and auditory cortex. The commonest cell type in the claustrum is a large spiny dendrite neuron whose axon leaves the nucleus after giving off local collaterals. Small spine-free cells, with beaded dendrites and a locally arborizing axon, are found also.

            "OBJECT: The goal in this study was to examine the microsurgical and tractographic anatomy of the claustrum and its projection fibers, and to analyze the functional and surgical implications of the findings. METHODS: Fifteen formalin-fixed human brain hemispheres were dissected using the Klingler fiber dissection technique, with the aid of an operating microscope at x 6-40 magnification. Magnetic resonance imaging studies of 5 normal brains were analyzed using diffusion tensor (DT) imaging-based tractography software. RESULTS: Both the claustrum and external capsule have 2 parts: dorsal and ventral. The dorsal part of the external capsule is mainly composed of the claustrocortical fibers that converge into the gray matter of the dorsal claustrum. Results of the tractography studies coincided with the fiber dissection findings and showed that the claustrocortical fibers connect the claustrum with the superior frontal, precentral, postcentral, and posterior parietal cortices, and are topographically organized. The ventral part of the external capsule is formed by the uncinate and inferior occipitofrontal fascicles, which traverse the ventral part of the claustrum, connecting the orbitofrontal and prefrontal cortex with the amygdaloid, temporal, and occipital cortices. The relationship between the insular surface and the underlying fiber tracts, and between the medial lower surface of the claustrum and the lateral lenticulostriate arteries is described. CONCLUSIONS: The combination of the fiber dissection technique and DT imaging-based tractography supports the presence of the claustrocortical system as an integrative network in humans and offers the potential to aid in understanding the diffusion of gliomas in the insula and other areas of the brain."

The tissue was processed sequentially for WGA-HRP, and then BDA immunohistochemistry using two different chromogens. Since the two labels were easily distinguishable on the same histological section, the interrelationship between the cerebellar and pallidal projection systems could be directly evaluated. We found that both the cerebellothalamic and pallidothalamic label consisted of dense plexuses of labeled fibers and swellings in a patch-like configuration. The patches or foci of labeling were distributed either as dense single label or as interdigitating patches of double label. We found dense single label in the central portion of the ventral anterior nucleus pars principalis (VApc) and the ventral lateral nucleus pars oralis (VLo) following the GPi injections or in the central portion of the ventral posterior lateral nucleus pars oralis (VPLo) and nucleus X (X) following the cerebellar nuclei injections. Complementary interdigitating patches of WGA-HRP and BDA labeling were found primarily in transitional border regions between thalamic nuclei. On occasion, we found overlap of both labels. We observed a gradient pattern in the density of the pallidothalamic and cerebellothalamic projections. The pallidothalamic territory included VApc, VLo, and the ventral lateral nucleus pars caudalis (VLc), with the density of these projections decreasing along an anterior to posterior gradient in the thalamus. Occasional patches of pallidal label were found in VPLo and nucleus X. Conversely, the density of cerebellothalamic projections increased along the same gradient, with the cerebellothalamic territory extending anteriorly beyond the cell-sparse zones of VPLo, X, and VLc to include VLo and VApc also. These data suggest that although the cerebellar and pallidal projections primarily occupy separate thalamic territories, individual thalamic nuclei receive differentially weighted inputs from these sources.",

Complementary interdigitating patches of WGA-HRP and BDA labeling were found primarily in transitional border regions between thalamic nuclei. On occasion, we found overlap of both labels. We observed a gradient pattern in the density of the pallidothalamic and cerebellothalamic projections. The pallidothalamic territory included VApc, VLo, and the ventral lateral nucleus pars caudalis (VLc), with the density of these projections decreasing along an anterior to posterior gradient in the thalamus. Occasional patches of pallidal label were found in VPLo and nucleus X. Conversely, the density of cerebellothalamic projections increased along the same gradient, with the cerebellothalamic territory extending anteriorly beyond the cell-sparse zones of VPLo, X, and VLc to include VLo and VApc also. These data suggest that although the cerebellar and pallidal projections primarily occupy separate thalamic territories, individual thalamic nuclei receive differentially weighted inputs from these sources."

AIP neurons respond to the sight of objects, as well as to the act of grasping them. We used retrograde transneuronal transport of rabies virus to examine subcortical inputs to AIP in the monkey. Virus transport labeled substantial numbers of neurons in the substantia nigra pars reticulata (SNpr), as well as in the dentate nucleus of the cerebellum. The hotspots of labeled neurons in SNpr and in dentate after AIP injections were separate from those created by virus injections into several other parietal or frontal regions. These observations provide the first evidence that a major output nucleus of the basal ganglia, the SNpr, projects to a region of posterior parietal cortex. In addition, our findings provide further support for the concept that posterior parietal cortex is a target of cerebellar output.",

            "The anterior intraparietal area (AIP) is a subregion of area 7b in posterior parietal cortex. AIP neurons respond to the sight of objects, as well as to the act of grasping them. We used retrograde transneuronal transport of rabies virus to examine subcortical inputs to AIP in the monkey. Virus transport labeled substantial numbers of neurons in the substantia nigra pars reticulata (SNpr), as well as in the dentate nucleus of the cerebellum. The hotspots of labeled neurons in SNpr and in dentate after AIP injections were separate from those created by virus injections into several other parietal or frontal regions. These observations provide the first evidence that a major output nucleus of the basal ganglia, the SNpr, projects to a region of posterior parietal cortex. In addition, our findings provide further support for the concept that posterior parietal cortex is a target of cerebellar output."

Although previous thalamostriatal studies emphasize projections from the intralaminar nuclei, studies in primates show a substantial projection from the ventral anterior (VA) and ventral lateral (VL) nuclei. These nuclei make up the main efferent projection from the basal ganglia to frontal cortical areas, including primary motor, supplementary, premotor, and cingulate motor areas. Functionally related motor areas of the frontal cortex and VA/VL have convergent projections to specific regions of the dorsal striatum. The distribution of VA/VL terminals within the striatum is crucial to understanding their relationship to motor cortical afferents. We placed anterograde tracer injections into discrete VA/VL thalamic areas. VA/VL thalamostriatal projections terminate in broad, rostrocaudal regions of the dorsal striatum, corresponding to regions innervated by functionally related cortical motor areas. The pars oralis division of VL projects primarily to the dorsolateral, postcommissural putamen, whereas the parvicellular VA targets more medial and rostral putamen regions, and the magnocellular division of VA targets the dorsal head of the caudate nucleus. Whereas these results demonstrate a general functional topography, specific VA/VL projections overlap extensively, suggesting that functionally distinct VA/VL projections may also converge in dorsal striatal areas. Within striatal territories, VA/VL projections terminate in a patchy, nonhomogeneous manner, indicating another level of complexity. Moreover, terminal fields contain both terminal clusters and scattered, long, unbranched fibers with many varicosities.

The tissue was processed sequentially for WGA-HRP, and then BDA immunohistochemistry using two different chromogens. Since the two labels were easily distinguishable on the same histological section, the interrelationship between the cerebellar and pallidal projection systems could be directly evaluated. We found that both the cerebellothalamic and pallidothalamic label consisted of dense plexuses of labeled fibers and swellings in a patch-like configuration. The patches or foci of labeling were distributed either as dense single label or as interdigitating patches of double label. We found dense single label in the central portion of the ventral anterior nucleus pars principalis (VApc) and the ventral lateral nucleus pars oralis (VLo) following the GPi injections or in the central portion of the ventral posterior lateral nucleus pars oralis (VPLo) and nucleus X (X) following the cerebellar nuclei injections. Complementary interdigitating patches of WGA-HRP and BDA labeling were found primarily in transitional border regions between thalamic nuclei. On occasion, we found overlap of both labels. We observed a gradient pattern in the density of the pallidothalamic and cerebellothalamic projections. The pallidothalamic territory included VApc, VLo, and the ventral lateral nucleus pars caudalis (VLc), with the density of these projections decreasing along an anterior to posterior gradient in the thalamus. Occasional patches of pallidal label were found in VPLo and nucleus X. Conversely, the density of cerebellothalamic projections increased along the same gradient, with the cerebellothalamic territory extending anteriorly beyond the cell-sparse zones of VPLo, X, and VLc to include VLo and VApc also. These data suggest that although the cerebellar and pallidal projections primarily occupy separate thalamic territories, individual thalamic nuclei receive differentially weighted inputs from these sources.",

Transfer to humans of connectional information derived from experimental studies in nonhuman primates requires agreement about the equivalence of nuclei in the different species, and dialogue between experimentalists and neurosurgeons would be facilitated by the use of a common nomenclature. In this review, the authors compare the different nomenclatures and review the cyto- and chemoarchitecture of the nuclei in the anterolateral aspect of the ventral nuclear mass in humans and monkeys, suggest which nuclei are equivalent, and propose a common terminology. On this basis, it is possible to identify the nuclei of the human motor thalamus that transfer information from the substantia nigra, globus pallidus, cerebellum, and proprioceptive components of the medial lemniscus to prefrontal, premotor, motor, and somatosensory areas of the cerebral cortex. It also becomes possible to suggest the principal functional systems involved in stereotactically guided thalamotomies and the functional basis of the symptoms observed following ischemic lesions in different parts of the human thalamus.",

In this review, the authors compare the different nomenclatures and review the cyto- and chemoarchitecture of the nuclei in the anterolateral aspect of the ventral nuclear mass in humans and monkeys, suggest which nuclei are equivalent, and propose a common terminology. On this basis, it is possible to identify the nuclei of the human motor thalamus that transfer information from the substantia nigra, globus pallidus, cerebellum, and proprioceptive components of the medial lemniscus to prefrontal, premotor, motor, and somatosensory areas of the cerebral cortex. It also becomes possible to suggest the principal functional systems involved in stereotactically guided thalamotomies and the functional basis of the symptoms observed following ischemic lesions in different parts of the human thalamus."

The labeled fibers reached these ipsilateral thalamic nuclei by coursing along or through the ansa lenticularis, the lenticular and thalamic fasciculi, and the Forel's fields. They arborized profusely in VA/VL nuclei where they displayed small glomerule-like formations. Numerous labeled fibers also occurred in the CM. Most of them were long, varicose and gave rise to shorter fibers that formed a dense terminal field covering a large portion of the CM. A small but dense terminal field composed of delicate fibers and extremely fine terminals was noted in the Hbl. A large contingent of labeled fibers were seen to cross the midline, principally at the rostral pole of the CM and in the supramammillary decussation, to reach the contralateral thalamus where they arborized profusely in the VA/VL and CM nuclei, but not in the Hbl. The patterns of termination of these contralateral pallidothalamic fibers were strikingly similar to those observed ipsilaterally. Other anterogradely labeled fibers were also noted bilaterally in the pedunculopontine nucleus (TPP) and ipsilaterally in the external segment of the pallidum (GPe) and in the putamen. Complementary, double-labeling, retrograde studies involving the injection of nuclear yellow in the VA/VL and CM nuclei and Fast blue in the TPP, confirmed the existence of contralateral pallidothalamic and pallidotegmental projections. The number of retrogradely labeled cells in the contralateral GPi amounted approximately to 10-20% that in the ipsilateral GPi. These experiments further indicated that contralaterally projecting pallidothalamic neurons exhibited a high degree of axonal collateralization, the majority of its neurons projecting also to the contralateral TPP. Cells retrogradely labeled with the tracer injected into the thalamus were also encountered bilaterally in the thalamic reticular nucleus. Taken together, the results of these anterograde and retrograde investigations indicate that the contralateral pallidothalamic projection involves a relatively small population of GPi neurons, but that these neurons arborize extensively in their contralateral thalamic targets. Furthermore, the presence of retrogradely labeled cells in the ipsi- and contralateral reticular thalamic nucleus indicates that the VA/VL and CM nuclei, which receive a massive input from the GPi, are under the bilateral influence of this perithalamic nucleus. Such contralateral projections could play a major role in the subcortical organization of the bilateral aspect of normal basal ganglia function.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",

On the other hand, injections in the dorsal one-third (group 3) and the rostromedial pole (group 4) of the GPi led to retrogradely labelled cells in the body of the caudate nucleus (\"associative striatum\") and the ventral striatum (\"limbic striatum\"), respectively. After those injections, dense plexuses of anterogradely labelled varicosities were found in common thalamic nuclei, including the parvocellular ventral anterior nucleus (VApc), the dorsal VL (VLd), and the rostrodorsal part of the parafascicular nucleus (PF). In the caudal two-thirds of the CM/PF, the labelled fibers formed a band that lay along the dorsal border of the complex in a region called the dorsolateral PF (PFdl) in this study. The ventromedial nucleus (VM) was densely labelled only after injections in the rostromedial GPi, whereas the dorsal part of the zona incerta was labelled in both groups. At the electron microscopic level, the BDA-positive terminals in the VLp were larger and more elongated than those in the CM but, overall, displayed the same pattern of synaptic organization. Our findings indicate 1) that some associative and limbic cortical information, which is largely processed in segregated corticostriatopallidal channels, converges to common thalamic nuclei and 2) that the PF is a major target of associative and limbic GPi efferents in monkeys.",

            "The objectives of this study were, on one hand, to better understand how the segregated functional pathways from the cerebral cortex through the striatopallidal complex emerged in the projections to the thalamus and, on the other hand, to compare the ultrastructure and synaptic organization of the pallidal efferents to the ventrolateral (VL) and centromedian (CM) thalamic nuclei in primates. These aims were achieved by injections of the retrograde-anterograde tracer, biotinylated dextran amine (BDA), in different functional regions of the internal pallidum (GPi) in squirrel monkeys. The location of retrogradely labelled cells in the striatum was determined to ascertain the functional specificity of the injection sites. Injections in the ventrolateral two-thirds of the GPi (group 1) led to retrograde labelling in the postcommissural region of the putamen (\"sensorimotor striatum\") and plexuses of labelled fibers in the rostral one-third of the principal ventrolateral nucleus (VLp) and the central part of the CM. On the other hand, injections in the dorsal one-third (group 3) and the rostromedial pole (group 4) of the GPi led to retrogradely labelled cells in the body of the caudate nucleus (\"associative striatum\") and the ventral striatum (\"limbic striatum\"), respectively.

The labeled fibers reached these ipsilateral thalamic nuclei by coursing along or through the ansa lenticularis, the lenticular and thalamic fasciculi, and the Forel's fields. They arborized profusely in VA/VL nuclei where they displayed small glomerule-like formations. Numerous labeled fibers also occurred in the CM. Most of them were long, varicose and gave rise to shorter fibers that formed a dense terminal field covering a large portion of the CM. A small but dense terminal field composed of delicate fibers and extremely fine terminals was noted in the Hbl. A large contingent of labeled fibers were seen to cross the midline, principally at the rostral pole of the CM and in the supramammillary decussation, to reach the contralateral thalamus where they arborized profusely in the VA/VL and CM nuclei, but not in the Hbl. The patterns of termination of these contralateral pallidothalamic fibers were strikingly similar to those observed ipsilaterally. Other anterogradely labeled fibers were also noted bilaterally in the pedunculopontine nucleus (TPP) and ipsilaterally in the external segment of the pallidum (GPe) and in the putamen. Complementary, double-labeling, retrograde studies involving the injection of nuclear yellow in the VA/VL and CM nuclei and Fast blue in the TPP, confirmed the existence of contralateral pallidothalamic and pallidotegmental projections. The number of retrogradely labeled cells in the contralateral GPi amounted approximately to 10-20% that in the ipsilateral GPi. These experiments further indicated that contralaterally projecting pallidothalamic neurons exhibited a high degree of axonal collateralization, the majority of its neurons projecting also to the contralateral TPP. Cells retrogradely labeled with the tracer injected into the thalamus were also encountered bilaterally in the thalamic reticular nucleus. Taken together, the results of these anterograde and retrograde investigations indicate that the contralateral pallidothalamic projection involves a relatively small population of GPi neurons, but that these neurons arborize extensively in their contralateral thalamic targets. Furthermore, the presence of retrogradely labeled cells in the ipsi- and contralateral reticular thalamic nucleus indicates that the VA/VL and CM nuclei, which receive a massive input from the GPi, are under the bilateral influence of this perithalamic nucleus. Such contralateral projections could play a major role in the subcortical organization of the bilateral aspect of normal basal ganglia function.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",

Two GABA-positive terminals types were commonly encountered within the TRN neuropil. The most common type of GABAergic terminals (F terminals) are filled with dispersed pleomorphic synaptic vesicles and clusters of mitochondria. These terminals establish multiple symmetric synapses upon the somata and dendrites of TRN neurons. The external pallidal terminals, labeled with WGA-HRP, arise from thinly myelinated axons and correspond to the medium to large F terminals. A less prevalent population of smaller GABAergic synaptic profiles was also identified. The synaptic profiles in this second group contain considerably fewer pleomorphic synaptic vesicles in small irregular clusters and fewer mitochondria, establish symmetric synapses, are postsynaptic to other axonal terminals, are presynaptic to dendrites and soma, and are unlabeled following pallidal injections of WGA-HRP.",

In the present study, by using awake monkeys, the polysynaptic effects of electrical stimulation in the forelimb regions of the primary motor and primary somatosensory cortices on the activity of globus pallidus (GP) neurons, especially mediated by the subthalamic nucleus (STN), have been characterized. Cortical stimulation induced an early, short-latency excitation followed by an inhibition and a late excitation in neurons of both the external and internal segments of the GP. It also induced an early, short-latency excitation followed by a late excitation and an inhibition in STN neurons. The early excitation in STN neurons preceded that in GP neurons. Blockade of STN neuronal activity by muscimol (GABA(A) receptor agonist) injection resulted in abolishment of both the early and late excitations evoked in GP neurons by cortical stimulation. At the same time, the spontaneous discharge rate of GP neurons decreased, pauses between the groups of spikes of GP neurons became prominent, and the firing pattern became regular. Injection of (+/-)-3-(2-carboxypiperazin-4-yl)-propyl-1-phosphonic acid (CPP) [N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist], but not 1,2,3, 4-tetrahydro-6-nitro-2,3-dioxo-benzo[f]quinoxaline-7-sulfonamide disodium [NBQX (non-NMDA receptor antagonist)], into the STN attenuated the early and late excitations in GP neurons, suggesting that cortico-subthalamic transmission is mediated mainly by NMDA receptors. Interference with the pallido-subthalamic transmission by bicuculline (GABA(A) receptor antagonist) injection into the STN made the inhibition distinct without affecting the early excitation. The present results indicate that the cortico-subthalamo-pallidal pathway conveys powerful excitatory effects from the motor-related cortical areas to the GP with shorter conduction time than the effects conveyed through the striatum.",

            "How the motor-related cortical areas modulate the activity of the output nuclei of the basal ganglia is an important issue for understanding the mechanisms of motor control by the basal ganglia. In the present study, by using awake monkeys, the polysynaptic effects of electrical stimulation in the forelimb regions of the primary motor and primary somatosensory cortices on the activity of globus pallidus (GP) neurons, especially mediated by the subthalamic nucleus (STN), have been characterized. Cortical stimulation induced an early, short-latency excitation followed by an inhibition and a late excitation in neurons of both the external and internal segments of the GP. It also induced an early, short-latency excitation followed by a late excitation and an inhibition in STN neurons. The early excitation in STN neurons preceded that in GP neurons. Blockade of STN neuronal activity by muscimol (GABA(A) receptor agonist) injection resulted in abolishment of both the early and late excitations evoked in GP neurons by cortical stimulation. At the same time, the spontaneous discharge rate of GP neurons decreased, pauses between the groups of spikes of GP neurons became prominent, and the firing pattern became regular. Injection of (+/-)-3-(2-carboxypiperazin-4-yl)-propyl-1-phosphonic acid (CPP) [N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist], but not 1,2,3, 4-tetrahydro-6-nitro-2,3-dioxo-benzo[f]quinoxaline-7-sulfonamide disodium [NBQX (non-NMDA receptor antagonist)], into the STN attenuated the early and late excitations in GP neurons, suggesting that cortico-subthalamic transmission is mediated mainly by NMDA receptors. Interference with the pallido-subthalamic transmission by bicuculline (GABA(A) receptor antagonist) injection into the STN made the inhibition distinct without affecting the early excitation. The present results indicate that the cortico-subthalamo-pallidal pathway conveys powerful excitatory effects from the motor-related cortical areas to the GP with shorter conduction time than the effects conveyed through the striatum."

Six capuchin monkeys (Cebus apella) received transcannular pontine HRP gel implants to retrogradely label the cells of origin of corticopontine projections. Four additional capuchin monkeys, one rhesus (Macaca mulatta), and one cynomolgus (Macaca fascicularis) monkey, received HRP gel implants in premotor (area 6), frontal eye field (FEF, area 8), superior (area 5), and inferior (area 7) parietal lobules to orthogradely label the course and termination of corticopontine projections, and thus to confirm the retrograde studies. The brains were processed according to the tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) protocol of Mesulam ('78) and studied with darkfield microscopy. Premotor (area 6) frontal cortex and FEF (area 8) were found to be the main sources of cortical inputs to the ipsilateral paramedian basilar pons, whereas FEF, dorsal prefrontal convexity, and dorsal medial prefrontal (granular frontal association) cortex were the main sources of bilateral projections to the paramedian pontine tegmentum. The medial portion of the nucleus reticularis tegmenti pontis (NRTP), considered to be a tegmental extension of the basilar pontine gray, also received its principal cortical input from the frontal lobe. Parietal cortex, on the other hand, was observed to project to lateral NRTP and lateral basilar pons. Although the possibility exists of convergence of frontal and parietal eye field efferents in the NRTP, the frontal eye field and prefrontal cortex appear to be the principal source of cortical projections to the paramedian pontine tegmentum, which contains the physiologically defined PPRF (paramedian pontine reticular formation), an important preoculomotor center. The results are discussed primarily with regard to their significance for potential cortical influence on the oculomotor system.",

            "The efferent connections of the cerebral cortex to paramedial tegmental and basilar pons were studied in the monkey by using the retrograde and orthograde capabilities of the horseradish peroxidase (HRP) technique. Six capuchin monkeys (Cebus apella) received transcannular pontine HRP gel implants to retrogradely label the cells of origin of corticopontine projections. Four additional capuchin monkeys, one rhesus (Macaca mulatta), and one cynomolgus (Macaca fascicularis) monkey, received HRP gel implants in premotor (area 6), frontal eye field (FEF, area 8), superior (area 5), and inferior (area 7) parietal lobules to orthogradely label the course and termination of corticopontine projections, and thus to confirm the retrograde studies. The brains were processed according to the tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) protocol of Mesulam ('78) and studied with darkfield microscopy. Premotor (area 6) frontal cortex and FEF (area 8) were found to be the main sources of cortical inputs to the ipsilateral paramedian basilar pons, whereas FEF, dorsal prefrontal convexity, and dorsal medial prefrontal (granular frontal association) cortex were the main sources of bilateral projections to the paramedian pontine tegmentum. The medial portion of the nucleus reticularis tegmenti pontis (NRTP), considered to be a tegmental extension of the basilar pontine gray, also received its principal cortical input from the frontal lobe. Parietal cortex, on the other hand, was observed to project to lateral NRTP and lateral basilar pons. Although the possibility exists of convergence of frontal and parietal eye field efferents in the NRTP, the frontal eye field and prefrontal cortex appear to be the principal source of cortical projections to the paramedian pontine tegmentum, which contains the physiologically defined PPRF (paramedian pontine reticular formation), an important preoculomotor center. The results are discussed primarily with regard to their significance for potential cortical influence on the oculomotor system."

The neurones were then labelled by intracellular ionophoresis of horseradish peroxidase and their morphology examined. All neurones studied were identified as pyramidal cells according to their morphology. 2. Six pyramidal neurones located in lamina V were well stained; they included two fast PTNs and two slow PTNs. The morphology of all pyramidal neurones in this lamina (fast PTNs, slow PTNs and those pyramidal cells that were not antidromically characterized) was essentially similar. A single apical dendrite branched as it ascended and its terminals arborized subpially. Numerous lateral and oblique dendrites branched from the apical dendrites in lamina V and near its border with lamina III: short basal dendrites arborized in the vicinity of the soma in lamina V. Long basal dendrites had a wider field of arborization in lamina V and sometimes extended into lamina VI. 3. Three to five collaterals arose from the axon of lamina V cells in the cortex and arborized in laminae V and VI. Short collateral branches arborized in the vicinity of the soma in the region of the basal and lateral dendrites. Long collateral branches could be traced over long distances (often more than 1 mm). One pyramidal neurone in this lamina (a fast PTN) lacked short collateral branches from the axon. 4. Four pyramidal neurones in lamina III were stained well. The dendritic morphology of all these neurones was similar. Apical dendrites branched as they ascended and terminated subpially. Lateral and basal dendrites formed a column of dendritic branches around the soma. No long basal dendrites were seen. 5. The number and arborization of intracortical collaterals from the axon of lamina III cells varied widely; from three to twelve collaterals arose from the axon. The biggest arbor of collateral branches involved all the cortical laminae and was about 3 mm wide mediolaterally, while the smallest arbor was restricted mainly to lamina III in the vicinity of the soma. One neurone in this lamina also lacked short collateral branches from the axon. 6.

The Nurr1(+)/CTGF(+) neurons coexpressed ER81 mRNA in monkeys but not in mice. On the basis of tracer injections in 3 monkeys, we found that the Nurr1(+) neurons in layer 6A send some corticocortical, but not corticopulvinar, projections. Although the Nurr1(+)/CTGF(-) neurons were restricted to lateral regions in the mouse cortex, they were present throughout the monkey cortex. Thus, an architectonic heterogeneity across areas and species was revealed for the neuronal subpopulations with distinct gene expression profiles.",

On the basis of tracer injections in 3 monkeys, we found that the Nurr1(+) neurons in layer 6A send some corticocortical, but not corticopulvinar, projections. Although the Nurr1(+)/CTGF(-) neurons were restricted to lateral regions in the mouse cortex, they were present throughout the monkey cortex. Thus, an architectonic heterogeneity across areas and species was revealed for the neuronal subpopulations with distinct gene expression profiles."

Current models of auditory cortical organization in primates describe a centrally located core region containing two or three subdivisions including the primary auditory area (AI), a surrounding belt of cortex with perhaps seven divisions, and a lateral parabelt region comprised of at least two fields. In monkeys the core region can be identified on the basis of specific anatomical and physiological features. In this study, the core was identified from serial sets of adjacent sections processed for cytoarchitecture, myeloarchitecture, acetylcholinesterase, and cytochrome oxidase. Qualitative and quantitative criteria were used to identify the borders of the core region in individual sections. Serial reconstructions of each brain were made showing the location of the core with respect to gross anatomical landmarks. The position of the core with respect to major sulci and gyri in the superior temporal region varied most in the chimpanzee and human specimens. Although the architectonic appearance of the core areas did vary in certain respects across taxonomic groups, the numerous similarities made it possible to identify unambiguously a homologous cortical region in macaques, chimpanzees, and humans.",

This cortical cholinergic innervation has been implicated in behavioral and cognitive functions, including learning and memory. Recent evidence revealed differences among primate species in the pattern of cholinergic innervation specific to the prefrontal cortex. While macaques displayed denser cholinergic innervation in layers I and II relative to layers V and VI, in chimpanzees and humans, layers V and VI were as heavily innervated as the supragranular layers. Furthermore, clusters of cholinergic axons were observed within the prefrontal cortex of both humans and chimpanzees to the exclusion of macaque monkeys, and were most commonly seen in humans. The aim of the present study was to determine whether the Ch4 cell group was modified during evolution of anthropoid primates as a possible correlate of these changes in cortical cholinergic innervation. We used stereologic methods to estimate the total number of choline acetyltransferase-immunoreactive magnocellular neurons within the nbM of New World monkeys, Old World monkeys, apes, and humans. Linear regression analyses were used to examine the relationship of the Ch4 cell group with neocortical volume and brain mass. Results showed that total nbM neuron numbers hyposcale relative to both neocortical volume and brain mass. Notably, the total number of nbM neurons in humans were included within the 95% confidence intervals for the prediction generated from nonhuman data. In conclusion, while differences in the cholinergic system exist among primate species, such changes appear to involve mostly axon collateral terminations within the neocortex and, with the exception of the relatively small group of cholinergic cells of the subputaminal subdivision of the nbM at the anterointermediate and rostrolateral levels, are not accompanied by a significant extra-allometric increase in the overall number of subcortical neurons that provide that innervation.",

In conclusion, while differences in the cholinergic system exist among primate species, such changes appear to involve mostly axon collateral terminations within the neocortex and, with the exception of the relatively small group of cholinergic cells of the subputaminal subdivision of the nbM at the anterointermediate and rostrolateral levels, are not accompanied by a significant extra-allometric increase in the overall number of subcortical neurons that provide that innervation."

The injection sites included the tail and genu of the caudate nucleus (14 cases), the head of the caudate (1 case), and the ventral putamen (3 cases). Retrogradely labeled cells were located predominantly in layer 5 of the ipsilateral cortex but were also found in layers 3 and 6. After caudate injections, labeled cells were found both in large, nearly continuous regions of cortex topographically related to the site of the injection, and in several smaller cortical regions that were discontinuous and common to many or all of the injection sites. The continuously labeled regions included nearly all known visual cortical areas, except for the striate cortex. After injections in the rostral tail, the continuously labeled region included the rostral portion of Bonin and Bailey's (Urbana: University of Illinois Press. '47) area TE and adjacent portions of TF, TH, TG, and, occasionally, area 35 (Brodmann, Leipzig: J.A. Barth. '09). After injections into the posterior tail and ventral genu, the labeled region shifted posteriorly in TE and TF, and into TEO and the ventral parts of prestriate areas V4, V3, and (sparsely) V2. As the injection site was advanced into the dorsal genu, the labeled region shifted dorsally toward the parietal lobe, including prestriate areas MT and PO, parietal area PG (Brodmann's area 7), the ventral and lateral intraparietal sulcal areas (VIP and LIP, respectively), and area PE and adjacent area LC (Brodmann's areas 5 and 23, respectively). The discontinuous areas labeled by many different injections included the principal sulcus/frontal eye field region, the anterior cingulate cortex, and the superior temporal polysensory area.

            "Reports from previous works has given different classifications for the nucleus accumbens. There also appears to be a general lack of information regarding the fiber connections of the nucleus. The present investigation was undertaken to clarify the connections of this structure. Silver impregnation methods were used to discern some of the afferent fibers of the nucleus, and autoradiographic techniques were used to locate target areas of efferent projections. Afferents were found to be predominately from the septum. Other sources of possible afferents were the mid cingulate gyrus and the ventral nucleus of the diagonal band. No argyrophilia was observed in the nucleus accumbens following transection of the fornix body, lesions of the anterior orbital frontal cortex or anterior cingulate gyrus. On the basis of grain counts made from autoradiographic studies, the nucleus accumbens projects predominately to the lateral hypothalamus. Counts above background were found in the cingulate gyrus, septum, ventral nucleus of the diagonal band, midline thalamic nuclei, habenula, caudate and substantia nigra. Thus, efferent projections appear to distribute to both limbic and extrapyramidal structures. Considering these connections and the functions reported by various workers the nucleus accumbens may serve as bridge between limbic and extrapyramidal motor systems effecting limbic influence in some movements."

The injection sites included the tail and genu of the caudate nucleus (14 cases), the head of the caudate (1 case), and the ventral putamen (3 cases). Retrogradely labeled cells were located predominantly in layer 5 of the ipsilateral cortex but were also found in layers 3 and 6. After caudate injections, labeled cells were found both in large, nearly continuous regions of cortex topographically related to the site of the injection, and in several smaller cortical regions that were discontinuous and common to many or all of the injection sites. The continuously labeled regions included nearly all known visual cortical areas, except for the striate cortex. After injections in the rostral tail, the continuously labeled region included the rostral portion of Bonin and Bailey's (Urbana: University of Illinois Press. '47) area TE and adjacent portions of TF, TH, TG, and, occasionally, area 35 (Brodmann, Leipzig: J.A. Barth. '09). After injections into the posterior tail and ventral genu, the labeled region shifted posteriorly in TE and TF, and into TEO and the ventral parts of prestriate areas V4, V3, and (sparsely) V2. As the injection site was advanced into the dorsal genu, the labeled region shifted dorsally toward the parietal lobe, including prestriate areas MT and PO, parietal area PG (Brodmann's area 7), the ventral and lateral intraparietal sulcal areas (VIP and LIP, respectively), and area PE and adjacent area LC (Brodmann's areas 5 and 23, respectively). The discontinuous areas labeled by many different injections included the principal sulcus/frontal eye field region, the anterior cingulate cortex, and the superior temporal polysensory area. Thus, whereas temporal, occipital, and parietal visual cortical areas project into the caudate largely according to proximity, certain multimodal cortical areas seem to have a much wider projection. To determine whether visual cortical areas have additional projections to the caudate beyond the territory of our retrograde injection sites in the tail and genu. 3H-labeled amino acids were injected into areas TE, V4, and MT in three additional monkeys. The topographic location of label in the tail and genu of the caudate in these cases was consistent with the results from injections of retrograde tracers into the caudate.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",

            "To determine the organization of visual inputs and outputs of the striatum, we placed multiple retrograde and anterograde tracers into physiologically identified portions of the striatum known to receive inputs from visual cortex in seven macaques. The injection sites included the tail and genu of the caudate nucleus (14 cases), the head of the caudate (1 case), and the ventral putamen (3 cases). Retrogradely labeled cells were located predominantly in layer 5 of the ipsilateral cortex but were also found in layers 3 and 6. After caudate injections, labeled cells were found both in large, nearly continuous regions of cortex topographically related to the site of the injection, and in several smaller cortical regions that were discontinuous and common to many or all of the injection sites. The continuously labeled regions included nearly all known visual cortical areas, except for the striate cortex. After injections in the rostral tail, the continuously labeled region included the rostral portion of Bonin and Bailey's (Urbana: University of Illinois Press. '47) area TE and adjacent portions of TF, TH, TG, and, occasionally, area 35 (Brodmann, Leipzig: J.A. Barth. '09). After injections into the posterior tail and ventral genu, the labeled region shifted posteriorly in TE and TF, and into TEO and the ventral parts of prestriate areas V4, V3, and (sparsely) V2. As the injection site was advanced into the dorsal genu, the labeled region shifted dorsally toward the parietal lobe, including prestriate areas MT and PO, parietal area PG (Brodmann's area 7), the ventral and lateral intraparietal sulcal areas (VIP and LIP, respectively), and area PE and adjacent area LC (Brodmann's areas 5 and 23, respectively). The discontinuous areas labeled by many different injections included the principal sulcus/frontal eye field region, the anterior cingulate cortex, and the superior temporal polysensory area. Thus, whereas temporal, occipital, and parietal visual cortical areas project into the caudate largely according to proximity, certain multimodal cortical areas seem to have a much wider projection. To determine whether visual cortical areas have additional projections to the caudate beyond the territory of our retrograde injection sites in the tail and genu. 3H-labeled amino acids were injected into areas TE, V4, and MT in three additional monkeys. The topographic location of label in the tail and genu of the caudate in these cases was consistent with the results from injections of retrograde tracers into the caudate.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"

Particular attention was paid to the topographic organization of terminal fields in the globus pallidus and substantia nigra, the projections to non-extrapyramidal areas, the relationship between projections from the nucleus accumbens and the other parts of the ventral striatum, and the comparison between ventral and dorsal striatal projections. This study demonstrates that in monkeys a circumscribed region of the globus pallidus receives topographically organized efferent fibers from the ventral striatum. The ventral striatal fibers terminate in the ventral pallidum, the subcommissural part of the globus pallidus, the rostral pole of the external segment, and the rostromedial portion of the internal segment. The more central and caudal portions of the globus pallidus do not receive this input. This striatal output appears to remain segregated from the dorsal striatal efferent projections to pallidal structures. Fibers from the ventral striatum projecting to the substantia nigra are not as confined to a specific region as those projecting to the globus pallidus. Although the densest terminal fields occur in the medial portion, numerous fibers also extend laterally to innervate the dorsal stratum of dopaminergic neurons of the substantia nigra and the retrorubral area. Furthermore, they project throughout the rostral-caudal extent of the substantia nigra. Projections from the medial part of the ventral striatum reach the more caudally located pedunculopontine tegmental nucleus. Thus unlike the above described terminals in the globus pallidus, the ventral striatum project widely throughout the substantia nigra, a fact that indicates that they may contribute to the integration between limbic and other output systems of the striatum.

As shown by retrograde and anterograde transports of wheatgerm agglutinin conjugated to horseradish peroxidase, the region of the nucleus accumbens related to the substantia nigra was found to receive bilateral inputs from restricted areas of the medial and lateral prefrontal cortex, i.e., prelimbic/medial orbital and dorsal agranular insular areas.

Interestingly, an important proportion (61%) of the nucleus accumbens-nigral cells responding to the stimulation of the lateral prefrontal cortex were also excited by the stimulation of the medial prefrontal cortex, demonstrating the existence of a convergent influence of these cortical areas on single nucleus accumbens cells. Furthermore, the present data also show that the stimulation of the medial prefrontal cortex results in a powerful inhibition of the tonic firing of the substantia nigra pars reticulata neurons. In conclusion, this study reveals the existence of a functional link between the prefrontal cortex (prelimbic/medial orbital and agranular insular areas) and the nucleus accumbens neurons which innervate the dorsomedial region of the substantia nigra pars reticulata. Since the dorsomedial region of substantia nigra pars reticulata is known to project to subfields of the mediodorsal and ventromedial thalamic nuclei related to the prefrontal cortex, the present data further demonstrate the existence of a prefrontal-nucleus accumbens-thalamo-cortical circuit involving the substantia nigra pars reticulata.",

Seventy-six single axons were reconstructed from serial sagittal sections with a camera lucida. The majority of labeled GPe cells displayed long, aspiny, and poorly branched dendrites that arborized mostly along the sagittal plane, whereas others showed dendrites radiating in all directions. Numerous GPe axons emitted short, intranuclear collaterals that arborized close to their parent cell body. Based on their axonal targets, four distinct types of GPe projection neurons have been identified: 1) neurons that project to the internal segment of the globus pallidus (GPi), the subthalamic nucleus (STN), and the substantia nigra, pars reticulata (SNr; 13.2%); 2) neurons that target the GPi and the STN (18.4%); 3) neurons that project to the STN and the SNr (52.6%); and 4) neurons that target the striatum (15.8%). Labeled GPe axons displayed large varicosities that often were closely apposed to the somata and proximal dendrites of STN, GPi, and SNr neurons. At striatal levels, however, GPe axons displayed small axonal varicosities that did not form perineuronal nets. These results suggest that the GPe is an important integrative locus in primate basal ganglia. This nucleus harbors several subtypes of projection neurons that are endowed with a highly patterned set of collaterals. This organization allows single GPe neurons to exert a multifarious effect not only on the STN, which is the claimed GPe target, but also on the two major output structures of the basal ganglia, the SNr and the GPi.",

These aims were achieved by injections of the retrograde-anterograde tracer, biotinylated dextran amine (BDA), in different functional regions of the internal pallidum (GPi) in squirrel monkeys. The location of retrogradely labelled cells in the striatum was determined to ascertain the functional specificity of the injection sites. Injections in the ventrolateral two-thirds of the GPi (group 1) led to retrograde labelling in the postcommissural region of the putamen (\"sensorimotor striatum\") and plexuses of labelled fibers in the rostral one-third of the principal ventrolateral nucleus (VLp) and the central part of the CM. On the other hand, injections in the dorsal one-third (group 3) and the rostromedial pole (group 4) of the GPi led to retrogradely labelled cells in the body of the caudate nucleus (\"associative striatum\") and the ventral striatum (\"limbic striatum\"), respectively. After those injections, dense plexuses of anterogradely labelled varicosities were found in common thalamic nuclei, including the parvocellular ventral anterior nucleus (VApc), the dorsal VL (VLd), and the rostrodorsal part of the parafascicular nucleus (PF). In the caudal two-thirds of the CM/PF, the labelled fibers formed a band that lay along the dorsal border of the complex in a region called the dorsolateral PF (PFdl) in this study. The ventromedial nucleus (VM) was densely labelled only after injections in the rostromedial GPi, whereas the dorsal part of the zona incerta was labelled in both groups. At the electron microscopic level, the BDA-positive terminals in the VLp were larger and more elongated than those in the CM but, overall, displayed the same pattern of synaptic organization. Our findings indicate 1) that some associative and limbic cortical information, which is largely processed in segregated corticostriatopallidal channels, converges to common thalamic nuclei and 2) that the PF is a major target of associative and limbic GPi efferents in monkeys.",

Previous studies showed that projections from sensory and motor cortices originate in layer VI and terminate as small boutons in central and caudal TRN. Here we show that prefrontal projections to TRN in rhesus monkeys have a different topographic organization and mode of termination. Prefrontal cortices projected mainly to the anterior TRN, at sites connected with the mediodorsal, ventral anterior, and anterior medial thalamic nuclei. However, projections from areas 46, 13, and 9 terminated widely in TRN and colocalized caudally with projections from temporal auditory, visual, and polymodal association cortices. Population analysis and serial EM reconstruction revealed two distinct classes of corticoreticular terminals synapsing with GABA/parvalbumin-positive dendritic shafts of TRN neurons. Most labeled boutons from prefrontal axons were small, but a second class of large boutons was also prominent. This is in contrast to the homogeneous small TRN terminations from sensory cortices noted previously and in the present study, which are thought to arise exclusively from layer VI. The two bouton types were often observed on the same axon, suggesting that both prefrontal layers V and VI could project to TRN. The dual mode of termination suggests a more complex role of prefrontal input in the functional regulation of TRN and gating of thalamic output back to the cortex. The targeting of sensory tiers of TRN by specific prefrontal areas may underlie attentional regulation for the selection of relevant sensory signals and suppression of distractors.",

All eight reconstructed tyrosine hydroxylase-positive dopaminergic neurons possessed widely spread and highly dense axonal arborizations in the neostriatum. All of them emitted very little axon collateral arborization outside of the striatum except for tiny arborization in the external pallidum. The striatal axonal bush of each reconstructed dopaminergic neuron covered 0.45-5.7% (mean +/- SD = 2.7 +/- 1.5%) of the total volume of the neostriatum. Furthermore, all the dopaminergic neurons innervated both striosome and matrix compartments of the neostriatum, although each neuron's arborization tended to favor one of these compartments. Our findings demonstrate that individual dopaminergic neurons of the substantia nigra can broadcast a dopamine signal and exert strong influence over a large number of striatal neurons. This divergent signaling should be a key to the function of the nigrostriatal system in dopamine-based learning and suggests that neurodegeneration of individual nigral neurons can affect multiple neurons in the striatum. Thus, these results would also contribute to understanding the clinicopathology of Parkinson's disease and related syndromes.",

            "The axonal arbors of single nigrostriatal dopaminergic neurons were visualized with a viral vector expressing membrane-targeted green fluorescent protein in rat brain. All eight reconstructed tyrosine hydroxylase-positive dopaminergic neurons possessed widely spread and highly dense axonal arborizations in the neostriatum. All of them emitted very little axon collateral arborization outside of the striatum except for tiny arborization in the external pallidum. The striatal axonal bush of each reconstructed dopaminergic neuron covered 0.45-5.7% (mean +/- SD = 2.7 +/- 1.5%) of the total volume of the neostriatum. Furthermore, all the dopaminergic neurons innervated both striosome and matrix compartments of the neostriatum, although each neuron's arborization tended to favor one of these compartments. Our findings demonstrate that individual dopaminergic neurons of the substantia nigra can broadcast a dopamine signal and exert strong influence over a large number of striatal neurons. This divergent signaling should be a key to the function of the nigrostriatal system in dopamine-based learning and suggests that neurodegeneration of individual nigral neurons can affect multiple neurons in the striatum. Thus, these results would also contribute to understanding the clinicopathology of Parkinson's disease and related syndromes."

Together with previous studies, our data suggest the existence of tightly connected functional circuits between the basal ganglia and the CM/Pf in primates: 1) A \"sensorimotor\" circuit links together the medial two-thirds of CM, the postcommissural putamen, and the ventrolateral part of the caudal GPi; 2) a \"limbic\" circuit involves the rostral one-third of Pf, the ventral striatum, and the rostromedial pole of GPi; and 3) an \"associative\"circuit exists between the caudal two-thirds of Pf, the caudate nucleus, and the SNr. An additional \"associative\" circuit that involves the caudate-receiving territory of GPi (dorsal one-third), the dorsolateral Pf (Pfdl), and the precommissural putamen was also disclosed.

Area 24 has three divisions of which area 24a is adjacent to the callosal sulcus and has the least laminar differentiation. Area 24b has more clearly defined layers II, III, and Va, and area 24c, which forms the lower bank of the anterior cingulate sulcus, has a particularly dense layer III. Area 23 also has three divisions, each of which has a distinct layer IV. Area 23a is adjacent to the callosal sulcus and has the thinnest layers II-IV, which have the same cell density as layers V and VI. Area 23b has the largest pyramids in layers IIIc and Va, and area 23c, in the depths of the posterior cingulate sulcus, has the broadest external and thinnest internal pyramidal layers. Finally, areas 29 and 30 are located in the posterior depths of the callosal sulcus. Two divisions of area 29 are apparent: one with a granular layer directly adjacent to layer I (area 29a-c) and another with differentiation of layers III and IV (area 29d). Area 30 has a dysgranular layer IV. Injections of the retrograde tracer horseradish peroxidase (HRP) were made into subdivisions of cingulate cortex in the monkey. Area 25 received thalamic input mainly from the midline parataenial (Pt), central densocellular (Cdc), and reuniens nuclei as well as from the dorsal parvicellular division of the mediodorsal nucleus (MDpc). A less dense projection also originated in the intralaminar parafascicular (Pf), central superior, and limitans (Li) nuclei as well as the medial division of the anterior nuclei (AM). Areas 24a and 24b received most thalamic afferents from fusiform and multipolar cells in the Cdc and Pf nuclei with fewer from the ventral anterior (VA) and MDpc and MD densocellular (MDdc) nuclei and only minor input from AM. Most input to premotor cingulate area 24c appeared to originate in VA, MDdc, and Li. Area 29 received the most dense input from nuclei traditionally associated with limbic cortex including the anteroventral (AV), anterodorsal (AD), and laterodorsal (LD) nuclei. Areas 23a and 23b, in contrast, did not receive AV, AD, or LD input, but the greatest proportion of their thalamic afferents arose in AM. Less-pronounced input also came from the lateroposterior (LP), medial pulvinar, and MDdc nuclei.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",

            "The cytoarchitecture and thalamic afferents of cingulate cortex were evaluated in the rhesus monkey (Macaca mulatta). Area 24 has three divisions of which area 24a is adjacent to the callosal sulcus and has the least laminar differentiation. Area 24b has more clearly defined layers II, III, and Va, and area 24c, which forms the lower bank of the anterior cingulate sulcus, has a particularly dense layer III. Area 23 also has three divisions, each of which has a distinct layer IV. Area 23a is adjacent to the callosal sulcus and has the thinnest layers II-IV, which have the same cell density as layers V and VI. Area 23b has the largest pyramids in layers IIIc and Va, and area 23c, in the depths of the posterior cingulate sulcus, has the broadest external and thinnest internal pyramidal layers. Finally, areas 29 and 30 are located in the posterior depths of the callosal sulcus. Two divisions of area 29 are apparent: one with a granular layer directly adjacent to layer I (area 29a-c) and another with differentiation of layers III and IV (area 29d). Area 30 has a dysgranular layer IV. Injections of the retrograde tracer horseradish peroxidase (HRP) were made into subdivisions of cingulate cortex in the monkey. Area 25 received thalamic input mainly from the midline parataenial (Pt), central densocellular (Cdc), and reuniens nuclei as well as from the dorsal parvicellular division of the mediodorsal nucleus (MDpc). A less dense projection also originated in the intralaminar parafascicular (Pf), central superior, and limitans (Li) nuclei as well as the medial division of the anterior nuclei (AM). Areas 24a and 24b received most thalamic afferents from fusiform and multipolar cells in the Cdc and Pf nuclei with fewer from the ventral anterior (VA) and MDpc and MD densocellular (MDdc) nuclei and only minor input from AM. Most input to premotor cingulate area 24c appeared to originate in VA, MDdc, and Li. Area 29 received the most dense input from nuclei traditionally associated with limbic cortex including the anteroventral (AV), anterodorsal (AD), and laterodorsal (LD) nuclei. Areas 23a and 23b, in contrast, did not receive AV, AD, or LD input, but the greatest proportion of their thalamic afferents arose in AM. Less-pronounced input also came from the lateroposterior (LP), medial pulvinar, and MDdc nuclei.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"

It is currently the most efficient target for deep brain stimulations designed to alleviate symptoms of Parkinson's disease. STN neurons were analyzed by applying stereological methods and single/double-immunostaining procedures to postmortem material obtained from normal individuals. Besides a multitude of closely packed projection neurons ( approximately 24.7 mum in diameter), the human STN (mean volume, 174.5 +/- 20.4 mm3; total neuronal density, 239.5 +/- 31.9 x 10(3)) contained smaller neurons (approximately 12.2 microm), which displayed glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD)(65/67) immunoreactivity and shared the morphological features of interneurons described in Golgi studies of primate STN. These putative gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)ergic interneurons accounted for 7.5% of the total neuronal population of the STN. Although present throughout the nucleus, they were significantly more numerous in its posterior-ventral-medial sector, which belongs to the limbic/associative functional territory. Many projection neurons located dorsolaterally in the STN showed parvalbumin immunoreactivity and others lying ventromedially displayed calretinin immunostaining, but none of the GAD-positive interneurons expressed these calcium-binding proteins. Although less abundant than projection neurons, GABAergic interneurons might play a important role in the intrinsic organization of the STN. The morphological and chemical heterogeneity of the human STN reported here might have important implications in the functional organization of the basal ganglia.",

            "The subthalamic nucleus (STN) is considered a homogeneous structure composed essentially of projection neurons that exert a profound glutamate-mediated excitatory influence upon the main output structures of the basal ganglia. It is currently the most efficient target for deep brain stimulations designed to alleviate symptoms of Parkinson's disease. STN neurons were analyzed by applying stereological methods and single/double-immunostaining procedures to postmortem material obtained from normal individuals. Besides a multitude of closely packed projection neurons ( approximately 24.7 mum in diameter), the human STN (mean volume, 174.5 +/- 20.4 mm3; total neuronal density, 239.5 +/- 31.9 x 10(3)) contained smaller neurons (approximately 12.2 microm), which displayed glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD)(65/67) immunoreactivity and shared the morphological features of interneurons described in Golgi studies of primate STN. These putative gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)ergic interneurons accounted for 7.5% of the total neuronal population of the STN. Although present throughout the nucleus, they were significantly more numerous in its posterior-ventral-medial sector, which belongs to the limbic/associative functional territory. Many projection neurons located dorsolaterally in the STN showed parvalbumin immunoreactivity and others lying ventromedially displayed calretinin immunostaining, but none of the GAD-positive interneurons expressed these calcium-binding proteins. Although less abundant than projection neurons, GABAergic interneurons might play a important role in the intrinsic organization of the STN. The morphological and chemical heterogeneity of the human STN reported here might have important implications in the functional organization of the basal ganglia."

Both CM and Pf project massively to the striatum where they arborize in a complementary fashion. On the one hand, CM innervates most of the putamen caudal to the anterior commissure, a dorsolateral rim of the putamen rostral to the anterior commissure, discrete areas of the head of the caudate nucleus close to the internal capsule, and a lateral sector of the body of the caudate nucleus. On the other hand, Pf provides a heavy input to the head, body, and tail of the caudate nucleus, and to the rostral putamen, excluding the areas innervated by CM. In addition, Pf projects more discretely to the nucleus accumbens and the olfactory tubercle. Therefore, the projections from both CM and Pf cover the entire striatum, with those from CM arborizing into the \"sensorimotor\" striatal territory and the ones from Pf innervating the \"associative-limbic\" striatal territory. Furthermore, CM and Pf project to extrastriatal subcortical structures, such as the globus pallidus, the subthalamic nucleus, and the substantia nigra, where they also terminate in a complementary fashion. Topographically and cytologically, Pf is closely related to the subparafascicular nucleus (sPf). The Pf-sPf complex projects to the hypothalamus, the substantia innominata, the peripeduncular nucleus, and the amygdala. It also gives rise to descending efferents arborizing in various brainstem structures, including the inferior olivary complex. Additional studies with retrograde double-labeling methods show that distinct cell groups within CM project to the motor cortex and the striatum. Likewise, separate neuronal populations within the CM-Pf-sPf complex give rise to striatal and brainstem projections, the former arising from CM and Pf and the latter mainly from sPf. The complementary nature of CM and Pf projections to the striatum and other basal ganglia components suggests that this thalamic complex participates in a highly ordered manner in the parallel processing of the information that flows through the basal ganglia.",

Both CM and Pf project massively to the striatum where they arborize in a complementary fashion. On the one hand, CM innervates most of the putamen caudal to the anterior commissure, a dorsolateral rim of the putamen rostral to the anterior commissure, discrete areas of the head of the caudate nucleus close to the internal capsule, and a lateral sector of the body of the caudate nucleus. On the other hand, Pf provides a heavy input to the head, body, and tail of the caudate nucleus, and to the rostral putamen, excluding the areas innervated by CM. In addition, Pf projects more discretely to the nucleus accumbens and the olfactory tubercle. Therefore, the projections from both CM and Pf cover the entire striatum, with those from CM arborizing into the \"sensorimotor\" striatal territory and the ones from Pf innervating the \"associative-limbic\" striatal territory. Furthermore, CM and Pf project to extrastriatal subcortical structures, such as the globus pallidus, the subthalamic nucleus, and the substantia nigra, where they also terminate in a complementary fashion. Topographically and cytologically, Pf is closely related to the subparafascicular nucleus (sPf). The Pf-sPf complex projects to the hypothalamus, the substantia innominata, the peripeduncular nucleus, and the amygdala. It also gives rise to descending efferents arborizing in various brainstem structures, including the inferior olivary complex. Additional studies with retrograde double-labeling methods show that distinct cell groups within CM project to the motor cortex and the striatum. Likewise, separate neuronal populations within the CM-Pf-sPf complex give rise to striatal and brainstem projections, the former arising from CM and Pf and the latter mainly from sPf. The complementary nature of CM and Pf projections to the striatum and other basal ganglia components suggests that this thalamic complex participates in a highly ordered manner in the parallel processing of the information that flows through the basal ganglia."

Our investigation shows that the CM and Pf nuclei in primates comprise three types of projection neurons: (1) neurons that innervate densely and focally the striatum; (2) neurons that arborize diffusely in the cerebral cortex; and (3) neurons that innervate both striatum and cerebral cortex.

Our results show that 1) after injections located in all the nuclei here studied, a consistent number of labeled neurons were found in the RT, except for the injections in the lateral habenula and the anterior thalamic nuclear complex, both of which did not label neurons in the RT. 2) Among the other thalamic nuclei here studied, the most medially situated receive less numerous RT projections than those most laterally located. 3) Injections in all the nuclei studied gave rise to a cellular labeling in the anterior sectors of the RT, except for the anterior nuclear group and the lateral habenula. The projections from the rostral pole of the RT were topographically mediolaterally organized. 4) The anterodorsal part of the pregeniculate sector of the RT projects upon the large-celled part of the lateral central nucleus and to a lesser extent upon the paracentral, centromedian, and ventromedial nuclei, the anterior part of the lateral central nucleus, and the lateral band of the mediodorsal nucleus. The posterodorsal part of the RT pregeniculate sector only projects to the large-celled part of the lateral central nucleus. The dorsal portion of the posteroventral part of the RT pregeniculate sector also projects upon the large-celled part of the lateral central nucleus; its ventral portion projects to the ventromedial nucleus, the posterior part of the paracentral nucleus, the lateral band of the mediodorsal nucleus, and the centromedian nucleus. 5) The infrageniculate sector of the RT projects to the posterior part of the ventromedial nucleus. A weaker projection to the large-celled part of the lateral central nucleus, the centromedian nucleus, and the lateral band of the mediodorsal nucleus was also observed. 6) The ventral lateral geniculate nucleus projects upon the large-celled part of the lateral central nucleus, the lateral band of the mediodorsal nucleus, and the ventromedial nucleus. All these findings suggest an important modulatory action of the RT on the activity of the thalamic nuclei considered here.",

The distributions of central cholinergic neurons as visualized by these two histochemical techniques were similar in most, but not all regions of the brain and spinal cord. Based upon these observations, central cholinergic neurons that are immunoreactive to ChAT and intensely stained for AChE by the pharmacohistochemical procedure can be divided into four major groups: (1) those in the caudate nucleus, putamen, nucleus accumbens and anterior perforated substance. These ChAT-containing and AChE-intense neurons are large and multipolar, and are scattered throughout these structures. (2) The rostral cholinergic column, which consists of a continuous mass of cholinergic perikarya situated in the medial septal nucleus, nucleus of the diagonal band, and nucleus basalis (Meynert). The ChAT-immunoreactive and AChE-intense cell bodies of the nucleus basalis are a prominent feature in the basal forebrain of the baboon. The labeled neurons are large, multipolar, and hyperchromic and show a tendency to aggregate in cell clusters. These cells are distributed within the full extent of the substantia innominata, often being associated with subcortical fiber networks such as the medullary laminae of the globus pallidus. (3) The caudal cholinergic column, which consists of a continuous group of cholinergic neurons in the caudal midbrain and pontine tegmentum. The rostral component of this group of cells is the nucleus tegmenti pedunculopontinus (subnucleus compacta) and it extends caudally to include the laterodorsal tegmental nucleus. Compared to that in other species the nucleus tegmenti pedunculopontinus in the baboon appears to occupy a relatively greater volume and is composed of a greater number of cholinergic neurons. The cells of the caudal column are large and hyperchromic. (4) Nuclei of origin of somatic and visceral efferents of the cranial nerves (III, IV, V, VI, VII, IX, X, XI, XII) and spinal nerves. In addition to these major cholinergic cell groups, a small population of ChAT-positive and AChE-intense cell bodies can be observed at the floor of the fourth ventricle and in lamina VII and X of the cervical cord. The present findings indicate that although some differences exist, the overall distribution and morphological features of cholinergic cell bodies identified in the baboon brain and spinal cord are similar to those demonstrated previously in investigations of the rhesus monkey and nonprimates.",

Large injections of CTb involving both pallidal segments produce numerous retrogradely labeled neurons in the substantia nigra (SN), the pedunculopontine tegmental nucleus (PPN) and the dorsal raphe nucleus (DR). Labeled neurons are distributed uniformly in SN with a slight numerical increase at the junction between the pars compacta (SNc) and the ventral tegmental area (VTA). Retrogradely labeled neurons abound also in PPN, principally in its pars dissipata, whereas other CTb-labeled cells are scattered throughout the rostrocaudal extent of DR. After CTb injection involving specifically the internal pallidal segment (GPi), the same pattern of cell distribution is found in SN, PPN and DR, except that the number of retrogradely labeled cells is lower than after large pallidal complex injections. Approximately 70% of all CTb-labeled neurons in SNc-VTA complex display TH immunoreactivity, whereas 20% are immunoreactive for CaBP. About 39% of all retrogradely labeled neurons in PPN are immunoreactive for ChAT, whereas approximately 38% of the labeled neurons in DR display 5-HT immunoreactivity. Following CTb injection in the external pallidal segment (GPe), the number of labeled cells is much smaller than after GPi injection. The majority of CTb-labeled cells in SNc-VTA complex are located in the lateral half of SNc and approximately 93% of these neurons display TH immunoreactivity compared to 10% that are immunoreactive for CaBP; very few CTb-labeled cells occur in PPN. Retrogradely labeled cells in DR are located more laterally than those that projects to the GPi and about 25% of them are immunoreactive for 5-HT. These results suggest that, in addition to their action at striatal and/or nigral levels, the brainstem dopaminergic, cholinergic and serotoninergic neurons influence the output of the primate basal ganglia by acting directly upon GPi neurons.",

            "The axonal projections of the internal pallidum (GPi) in cynomolgus monkeys (Macaca fascicularis) were studied by labeling small pools of neurons with biotinylated dextran amine. Fifty-two axons were reconstructed entirely from serial sections with a camera lucida. Two types of projection neurons were identified in the GPi on the basis of their target sites. The abundant and centrally located type I neurons gave rise to a long axonal branch that descended directly to the pedunculopontine tegmental nucleus, where it arborized discretely. Other branches ascended to the thalamus and broke into 10-15 thinner collaterals that ran through most of the ventral anterior nucleus, where they terminated as typical plexuses. About half of these axons gave rise to collaterals that arborized in both components of the centre median/parafascicular thalamic complex. The less numerous and peripherally located type II neurons had an axon that climbed the rostral thalamic pole, coursed along the stria medullaris, and arborized profusely within the lateral habenular nucleus, which stood out as the most densely innervated pallidal target. Some type II axons provided collaterals to the anterior thalamic nuclei. A small proportion of axons of both types had branches that crossed the midline and terminated in contralateral GPi target structures. Three-dimensional reconstruction showed that type I axons arborized principally along the sagittal plane. These data reveal that GPi neurons of type I act through a widely distributed axonal network upon thalamic and brainstem premotor neurons, whereas type II neurons act in a much more focused manner upon lateral habenular neurons."

Our investigation shows that the CM and Pf nuclei in primates comprise three types of projection neurons: (1) neurons that innervate densely and focally the striatum; (2) neurons that arborize diffusely in the cerebral cortex; and (3) neurons that innervate both striatum and cerebral cortex.

The CM neurons that target cerebral cortex arborize principally in motor and premotor areas, whereas Pf neurons innervate chiefly prefrontal areas. Cortical innervation from both nuclei is much more profuse in layers V and VI than in layer I. Our three-dimensional reconstruction studies show that dendritic and axonal arborizations of CM neurons extend essentially along the sagittal plane. These results revealed that, in contrast to rodents where virtually all Pf neurons project to both striatum and cortex, the primate CM/Pf complex harbors several types of highly patterned projection neurons.

            "The two main types of corticostriatal neurons are those that project only intratelencephalically (IT-type), the intrastriatal terminals of which are 0.41 microm in mean diameter, and those that send their main axon into pyramidal tract and have a collateral projection to striatum (PT-type), the intrastriatal terminals of which are 0.82 microm in mean diameter. We used three approaches to examine whether the two striatal projection neuron types (striatonigral direct pathway vs striatopallidal indirect pathway) differ in their input from IT-type and PT-type neurons. First, we retrogradely labeled one striatal projection neuron type or the other with biotinylated dextran amine (BDA)-3000 molecular weight. We found that terminals making asymmetric axospinous contact with striatonigral neurons were 0.43 microm in mean diameter, whereas those making asymmetric axospinous contact with striatopallidal neurons were 0.69 microm. Second, we preferentially immunolabeled striatonigral neurons for D1 dopamine receptors or striatopallidal neurons for D2 dopamine receptors and found that axospinous terminals had a smaller mean size (0.45 microm) on D1+ spines than on D2+ spines (0.61 microm). Finally, we combined selective BDA labeling of IT-type or PT-type terminals with immunolabeling for D1 or D2, and found that IT-type terminals were twice as common as PT-type on D1+ spines, whereas PT-type terminals were four times as common as IT-type on D2+ spines. These various results suggest that striatonigral neurons preferentially receive input from IT-type cortical neurons, whereas striatopallidal neurons receive greater input from PT-type cortical neurons. This differential cortical connectivity may further the roles of the direct and indirect pathways in promoting desired movements and suppressing unwanted movements, respectively."

Following selective injections of the anterograde axonal tracer Phaseolus vulgaris-leucoagglutinin (PHA-L) into the CM or Pf, patterns of terminal arborization within the striatum were compared to the biochemical heterogeneity of the striatum as revealed by immunohistochemical staining for the calcium-binding protein calbindin D-28k (CaBP), and histochemical staining for the enzymes acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate-diaphorase (NADPH-diaphorase). The PHA-L-labeled axon terminals within the striatum were further analyzed at the ultrastructural level to characterize their pattern of synaptic organization. Dense and heterogeneous terminal fields occur in the \"sensorimotor\" territory of the striatum after CM injections, or in the \"associative\" striatal territory following Pf injections. In the associative territory labeled axons arborize in a diffuse manner predominantly within areas enriched with CaBP, AChE, or NADPH-diaphorase, representing the matrix compartment, and tend to avoid areas poor in these substances, corresponding to the patch/striosome compartment. In the sensorimotor territory labeled axons form bands that occupy a subregion of the NADPH-diaphorase-rich zone in the putamen. The terminal pattern of the CM-striatal projection suggests the existence of a more complex mosaic organization within the sensorimotor territory. Ultrastructural analysis of PHA-L-labeled elements within the striatum reveals that both CM and Pf projections form asymmetric synapses upon dendrites and spines of striatal cells. A total of 339 PHA-L-labeled boutons were examined after CM injections and compared to 293 boutons following Pf injections. After CM injections, 29% of PHA-L-labeled terminals form synapses on dendritic spines and 66% on dendritic shafts, whereas after Pf injections only 12% of synapses occur on dendritic spines compared to 81% on dendritic shafts. Labeled terminals forming axosomatic or axoaxonic synapses were not seen within the striatum following either CM or Pf injections. It is concluded that in the squirrel monkey: 1) Pf-striatal fibers profusely arborize within the matrix compartment of the associative territory, 2) CM-striatal fibers form bands that occupy a subregion of the NADPH-diaphorase-rich zone within the sensorimotor territory, and 3) that both Pf- and CM-striatal projections establish asymmetric synapses with dendrites and spines of medium-sized spiny cells.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",

The microinjections were centered on layer V, and 42 anterogradely labeled corticofugal axons were reconstructed from serial frontal or sagittal sections with a camera lucida. Our investigation shows that the primate striatum receives both direct and indirect projections from M1. The direct corticostriatal projection is formed by axons that remain uniformly thin and unbranched throughout their sinuous trajectory to the ipsilateral striatum. They divide as they enter the dorsolateral sector of the post-commissural putamen, the so-called sensorimotor striatal territory. The indirect corticostriatal projection derives from a thin collateral emitted within the corona radiata by thick, long-range fibers that descend toward the brainstem. The collateral enters the putamen dorsomedially and remains unbranched until it reaches the dorsolateral sector of the putamen, where it breaks out into two to four axonal branches displaying small and equally spaced varicosities. Both direct and indirect corticostriatal axons branch moderately but occupy vast rostrocaudal striatal territories, where they appear to contact en passant several widely distributed striatal neurons. These findings reveal that, in contrast to current beliefs, the primate motor corticostriatal system is not exclusively formed by axons dedicated solely to the striatum. It also comprises collaterals from long-range corticofugal axons, which can thus provide to the striatum a copy of the neural information that is being conveyed to the brainstem and/or spinal cord.",

            "Axonal projections arising from the external segment of the globus pallidus (GPe) in cynomolgus monkeys (Macaca fascicularis) were mapped after labeling small pools (5-15 cells) of neurons with biotinylated dextran amine. Seventy-six single axons were reconstructed from serial sagittal sections with a camera lucida. The majority of labeled GPe cells displayed long, aspiny, and poorly branched dendrites that arborized mostly along the sagittal plane, whereas others showed dendrites radiating in all directions. Numerous GPe axons emitted short, intranuclear collaterals that arborized close to their parent cell body. Based on their axonal targets, four distinct types of GPe projection neurons have been identified: 1) neurons that project to the internal segment of the globus pallidus (GPi), the subthalamic nucleus (STN), and the substantia nigra, pars reticulata (SNr; 13.2%); 2) neurons that target the GPi and the STN (18.4%); 3) neurons that project to the STN and the SNr (52.6%); and 4) neurons that target the striatum (15.8%). Labeled GPe axons displayed large varicosities that often were closely apposed to the somata and proximal dendrites of STN, GPi, and SNr neurons. At striatal levels, however, GPe axons displayed small axonal varicosities that did not form perineuronal nets. These results suggest that the GPe is an important integrative locus in primate basal ganglia. This nucleus harbors several subtypes of projection neurons that are endowed with a highly patterned set of collaterals. This organization allows single GPe neurons to exert a multifarious effect not only on the STN, which is the claimed GPe target, but also on the two major output structures of the basal ganglia, the SNr and the GPi."

One of the pivotal reasons for this reappraisal has been new information about basal ganglia and cerebellar connections with the cerebral cortex. In essence, recent anatomical studies have revealed that these connections are organized into discrete circuits or 'loops'. Rather than serving as a means for widespread cortical areas to gain access to the motor system, these loops reciprocally interconnect a large and diverse set of cerebral cortical areas with the basal ganglia and cerebellum. The properties of neurons within the basal ganglia or cerebellar components of these circuits resembles the properties of neurons within the cortical areas subserved by these loops. For example, neuronal activity within basal ganglia and cerebellar loops with motor areas of the cerebral cortex is highly correlated with parameters of movement, while neuronal activity within basal ganglia and cerebellar loops with areas of the prefrontal cortex is more related to aspects of cognitive function. Thus, individual loops appear to be involved in distinct behavioral functions. Studies of basal ganglia and cerebellar pathology support this conclusion. Damage to the basal ganglia or cerebellar components of circuits with motor areas of cortex leads to motor symptoms, whereas damage of the subcortical components of circuits with non-motor areas of cortex causes higher-order deficits. In this report, we review some of the new anatomical, physiological and behavioral findings that have contributed to a reappraisal of function concerning the basal ganglia and cerebellar loops with the cerebral cortex.",

These genes outline the numerous subtypes of pyramidal cells and are increasingly refining our previous classifications. They also indicate specific developmental programs operate in cell fate decisions. This review will describe the progress made on the correlation of these markers to each other within a specific subtype of layer V neurons with identified, stereotypic projections. Further work is needed to link these data with observations on somatodendritic morphology and physiological properties. The integrated molecular, anatomical and physiological characterisation of pyramidal neurons will lead to a much better appreciation of functional cortical circuits."

In order to address some of these questions, we labeled PC connections by extracellular injections of biotinylated dextran amine into the lateral pulvinar of two monkeys, and analyzed 25 individual axons in several extrastriate areas by serial section reconstruction. This approach yielded four results: (1) in all extrastriate areas examined (V2, V3, V4, and middle temporal area [MT]/V5), PC axons consistently have 2-6 multiple, spatially distributed arbors; (2) in each area, there is a small number of larger caliber axons, possibly originating from a subpopulation of calbindin-positive giant projection neurons in the pulvinar; (3) as previously reported by others, most terminations in extrastriate areas are concentrated in layer 3, but they can occur in other layers (layers 4,5,6, and, occasionally, layer 1) as collaterals of a single axon; in addition, (4) the size of individual arbors and of the terminal field as a whole varies with cortical area. In areas V2 and V3, there is typically a single principal arbor (0.25-0.50 mm in diameter) and several smaller arbors. In area V4, the principal arbor is larger (2.0- to 2.5-mm-wide), but in area MT/V5, the arbors tend to be smaller (0.15 mm in diameter). Size differences might result from specializations of the target areas, or may be more related to the particular injection site and how this projects to individual cortical areas. Feedforward cortical axons, except in area V2, have multiple arbors, but these do not show any obvious size progression. Thus, in areas V2, V3, and especially V4, PC fields are larger than those of cortical axons, but in MT/V5 they are smaller. Terminal specializations of PC connections tend to be larger than those of corticocortical, but the projection foci are less dense. Further work is necessary to determine the differential interactions within and between systems, and how these might result in the complex patterns of suppression and enhancement, postulated as gating mechanisms in cortical attentional effects, or in different states of arousal.",

In order to address some of these questions, we labeled PC connections by extracellular injections of biotinylated dextran amine into the lateral pulvinar of two monkeys, and analyzed 25 individual axons in several extrastriate areas by serial section reconstruction. This approach yielded four results: (1) in all extrastriate areas examined (V2, V3, V4, and middle temporal area [MT]/V5), PC axons consistently have 2-6 multiple, spatially distributed arbors; (2) in each area, there is a small number of larger caliber axons, possibly originating from a subpopulation of calbindin-positive giant projection neurons in the pulvinar; (3) as previously reported by others, most terminations in extrastriate areas are concentrated in layer 3, but they can occur in other layers (layers 4,5,6, and, occasionally, layer 1) as collaterals of a single axon; in addition, (4) the size of individual arbors and of the terminal field as a whole varies with cortical area. In areas V2 and V3, there is typically a single principal arbor (0.25-0.50 mm in diameter) and several smaller arbors. In area V4, the principal arbor is larger (2.0- to 2.5-mm-wide), but in area MT/V5, the arbors tend to be smaller (0.15 mm in diameter). Size differences might result from specializations of the target areas, or may be more related to the particular injection site and how this projects to individual cortical areas. Feedforward cortical axons, except in area V2, have multiple arbors, but these do not show any obvious size progression. Thus, in areas V2, V3, and especially V4, PC fields are larger than those of cortical axons, but in MT/V5 they are smaller. Terminal specializations of PC connections tend to be larger than those of corticocortical, but the projection foci are less dense. Further work is necessary to determine the differential interactions within and between systems, and how these might result in the complex patterns of suppression and enhancement, postulated as gating mechanisms in cortical attentional effects, or in different states of arousal."

        "pm_abstract": "The thalamic relations of the caudal inferior parietal lobule and the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex in monkeys have been investigated with both anterograde and retrograde neuroanatomical tracing techniques. The results of these experiments indicate that the medial pulvinar nucleus (Pul.m.) is the principal thalamic relay to the gyral surface of the caudal inferior parietal lobule (area 7a). Within the Pul.m. there are two or three disklike aggregates of neurons which project to area 7a; these disklike neuronal aggregates are oriented from dorsomedial to ventrolateral and extend over most of the rostrocaudal extent of the nucleus. Within these disks there are rodlike clusters of neurons which are elongated in the rostrocaudal dimension of the thalamus, and which project in a topographically ordered manner to area 7a. Thus, the more rostrally located neurons within the Pul.m. disks project to more rostral parts of area 7a and, conversely, the more caudally located neurons project to the caudal part of this cortical field. Similarly, the medial part of each disk projects to the lateral part of area 7a while the laterally placed neurons project to the medial part of the cortical field. In addition to its input from the Pul.m., area 7a is also reciprocally connected with the magnocellular division of the nucleus ventralis anterior, with the nuclei which abut upon the medullary capsule of the laterodorsal nucleus, and with the suprageniculate nucleus and the nucleus limitans. The cortex on the lateral bank of the intraparietal sulcus (the so-called lateral intraparietal area, LIP) projects principally to the lateral pulvinar nucleus (Pul.l) of the thalamus rather than to Pul.m. Area LIP has been found to project to the pregeniculate nucleus, the zona incerta, the anterior pretectal nucleus, and the superior colliculus. Area 7a projects to none of these structures, but it does project to the posterior pretectal nucleus. The thalamic relations of the neighboring cortical regions, such as the prelunate gyrus and area 7b, are also distinct from those of area 7a. It thus seems that the prelunate gyrus is primarily interconnected with the Pul.l., and area 7b with the oral pulvinar nucleus. Taken together these different subcortical relationships provide further evidence for the view that the caudal inferior parietal lobule is not a homogeneous cortical area, but is composed of a number of subsidiary fields. The projection from the Pul.m. to the lateral prefrontal cortex arises from disklike aggregates of neurons, similar in their orientation to the neuronal disks that project to area 7a.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",

            "The thalamic relations of the caudal inferior parietal lobule and the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex in monkeys have been investigated with both anterograde and retrograde neuroanatomical tracing techniques. The results of these experiments indicate that the medial pulvinar nucleus (Pul.m.) is the principal thalamic relay to the gyral surface of the caudal inferior parietal lobule (area 7a). Within the Pul.m. there are two or three disklike aggregates of neurons which project to area 7a; these disklike neuronal aggregates are oriented from dorsomedial to ventrolateral and extend over most of the rostrocaudal extent of the nucleus. Within these disks there are rodlike clusters of neurons which are elongated in the rostrocaudal dimension of the thalamus, and which project in a topographically ordered manner to area 7a. Thus, the more rostrally located neurons within the Pul.m. disks project to more rostral parts of area 7a and, conversely, the more caudally located neurons project to the caudal part of this cortical field. Similarly, the medial part of each disk projects to the lateral part of area 7a while the laterally placed neurons project to the medial part of the cortical field. In addition to its input from the Pul.m., area 7a is also reciprocally connected with the magnocellular division of the nucleus ventralis anterior, with the nuclei which abut upon the medullary capsule of the laterodorsal nucleus, and with the suprageniculate nucleus and the nucleus limitans. The cortex on the lateral bank of the intraparietal sulcus (the so-called lateral intraparietal area, LIP) projects principally to the lateral pulvinar nucleus (Pul.l) of the thalamus rather than to Pul.m. Area LIP has been found to project to the pregeniculate nucleus, the zona incerta, the anterior pretectal nucleus, and the superior colliculus. Area 7a projects to none of these structures, but it does project to the posterior pretectal nucleus. The thalamic relations of the neighboring cortical regions, such as the prelunate gyrus and area 7b, are also distinct from those of area 7a. It thus seems that the prelunate gyrus is primarily interconnected with the Pul.l., and area 7b with the oral pulvinar nucleus. Taken together these different subcortical relationships provide further evidence for the view that the caudal inferior parietal lobule is not a homogeneous cortical area, but is composed of a number of subsidiary fields. The projection from the Pul.m. to the lateral prefrontal cortex arises from disklike aggregates of neurons, similar in their orientation to the neuronal disks that project to area 7a.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"

In the granular cortex (areas 3b and AI), the thalamic plexus is densest and coarsest; it fills all of layers IV and IIIB and extends into layer IIIA. In the \"second\" and \"third\" sensory areas, such as the second somatic sensory and many of the auditory fields, the density of the plexus and its coarseness diminish slightly and the deeper half of layer IV becomes free of terminals. In the homotypical cortex, the plexus becomes sparser, finer and strictly confined to layer IIIB. In many areas there are additional indications of thalamic terminations in deeper layers. Where layers V and VI are not divided into sublaminae (e.g.,in areas 3b and AI) there is labeling of the superficial half of layer VI. Where layers V and VI become subdivided in the homotypical cortex, the auditory and adjacent fields were only observed in cases in which the magnocellular nucleus of the medial geniculate body was involved by the injection of isotope. The boundaries of the cortical projection fields of individual thalamic nuclei, as determined autoradiographically, are remarkably sharp and invariably coincide with a sharp architectonic boundary or with a zone of maximal cytoarchitectonic change. Zones of apparent architectonic transition never showed overlap of thalamic afferents emanating from more than one nucleus. These results raise for discussion the significance of architectonic structure in relation to cortical connectivity and have a bearing upon those studies that have attempted to relate the terminals of thalamic afferents to particular classes of cortical neuron."

            "This paper addresses the question of a general topological principle of thalamo-cortical projections. In the lissencephalic primate brain of the common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus), large injections of horseradish peroxidase were made in various parts of the neocortex. These injections were placed in different animals and hemispheres along various caudo-rostral and medio-lateral gradients. Labelled cells in the thalamus were plotted and the labelling-zones resulting from several injections along a medio-lateral and two caudo-rostral cortical vectors were drawn into semi-schematic thalamic maps. These composite maps reveal a topological organization of the whole thalamo-cortical projection. The thalamic representation of the caudo-rostral and medio-lateral gradients indicate a rotation of the posterior relative to the anterior thalamus. An attempt is made to relate the organization of the thalamo-cortical projection to the development of the thalamus and the cortex. The cortex is divided into concentric zones around the sensory-motor and insular cortex. The thalamus is divided into corresponding projection zones. The topology of thalamo-cortical connections can then be regarded as a consequence of corresponding thalamic and cortical growth gradients. This is not only consistent with the general thalamo-cortical topology and the inversion of maps from thalamus to cortex, but also explains the continuity and overlap of thalamic projection zones in the pulvinar to widely separated cortical areas as the parietal, temporal and frontal association cortex."

In the present study, WGA-HRP was injected into major subdivisions of the mediodorsal nucleus (MD) in the rhesus monkey in order to determine 1) The areal distribution of MD projections, 2) the layer(s) in which MD afferents terminate, 3) the tangential pattern of the MD axonal terminals, 4) the cells of origin of the reciprocal corticothalamic pathway, and 5) the degree of reciprocity between the corticothalamic and thalamocortical pathways in the different regions of the prefrontal cortex. As expected on the basis of retrograde degeneration and transport studies, injections centered in the magnocellular (MDmc) subnucleus of MD labeled cells and terminals in the ventral and medial prefrontal cortex. Injections involving ventral MDmc labeled the more lateral of these areas (Walker's areas 11 and 12); injections of the dorsal MDmc labeled the ventromedial regions (areas 13 and 14). In contrast, injections involving mainly the lateral, parvicellular (MDpc) moiety labeled cells and terminals in dorsolateral and dorsomedial areas (Walker's 46, 9, and 8B). Area 8A was labeled most prominently when injections included the multiform portion of MD (MDmf) and area 10 had connections with anterior portions of MD. A dorsal-ventral topography for MDpc exists with dorsal MDpc labeling dorsal and dorsomedial prefrontal areas and ventral MDpc labeling dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. Our findings with respect to MD are consistent with a nucleus-to-field organization of its thalamocortical projection system. Outside of the traditional boundaries of prefrontal cortex, lateral MD projections extended to the supplementary motor area (SMA) and the dorsal part of the anterior cingulate (AC) whereas the medial MD projection targeted the ventromedial cingulate cortex and spared SMA. In addition, a few labeled cells and sparse terminals were found in the inferior parietal lobule, the superior temporal sulcus, and the anterior part of the insula after injections that involved the medial part of MD. Labeled terminals were invariably confined to layer IV and adjacent deep layer III. No terminal label was ever observed in layers I, II, superficial III, V, or VI in any part of the cerebral cortex following injections confined to any part of MD.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",

            "The terminal distribution of thalamic afferents in primate prefrontal cortex has never been examined in any detail. In the present study, WGA-HRP was injected into major subdivisions of the mediodorsal nucleus (MD) in the rhesus monkey in order to determine 1) The areal distribution of MD projections, 2) the layer(s) in which MD afferents terminate, 3) the tangential pattern of the MD axonal terminals, 4) the cells of origin of the reciprocal corticothalamic pathway, and 5) the degree of reciprocity between the corticothalamic and thalamocortical pathways in the different regions of the prefrontal cortex. As expected on the basis of retrograde degeneration and transport studies, injections centered in the magnocellular (MDmc) subnucleus of MD labeled cells and terminals in the ventral and medial prefrontal cortex. Injections involving ventral MDmc labeled the more lateral of these areas (Walker's areas 11 and 12); injections of the dorsal MDmc labeled the ventromedial regions (areas 13 and 14). In contrast, injections involving mainly the lateral, parvicellular (MDpc) moiety labeled cells and terminals in dorsolateral and dorsomedial areas (Walker's 46, 9, and 8B). Area 8A was labeled most prominently when injections included the multiform portion of MD (MDmf) and area 10 had connections with anterior portions of MD. A dorsal-ventral topography for MDpc exists with dorsal MDpc labeling dorsal and dorsomedial prefrontal areas and ventral MDpc labeling dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. Our findings with respect to MD are consistent with a nucleus-to-field organization of its thalamocortical projection system. Outside of the traditional boundaries of prefrontal cortex, lateral MD projections extended to the supplementary motor area (SMA) and the dorsal part of the anterior cingulate (AC) whereas the medial MD projection targeted the ventromedial cingulate cortex and spared SMA. In addition, a few labeled cells and sparse terminals were found in the inferior parietal lobule, the superior temporal sulcus, and the anterior part of the insula after injections that involved the medial part of MD.

The retrogradely labelled thalamic neurons formed longitudinal bands, some of which crossed the internal medullary lamina, and extended from one thalamic nucleus into another. On the basis of these findings the frontal cortex was subdivided into seven transverse cortical strips which receive afferents from seven longitudinal bands of thalamic neurons. The most rostral transverse strip receives afferents from the most medial thalamic band which is oriented vertically and extends through the most medial part of the MD into the medial pulvinar. Progressively more caudally located transverse strips receive afferents from progressively more laterally located thalamic bands which in part are situated in the VL and show an increasing tilt towards the horizontal. Moreover, those parts of the various bands which are situated along the dorsal and lateral margin of the thalamus project to the medial portions of the transverse cortical strips, i.e. along the medial margin of the frontal lobe, while the other parts situated ventromedially in the thalamus project to the lateral portions of these strips, i.e. along the lateral margin of the frontal lobe. These data provide an alternative view of the organization of the thalamus and suggest that this structure contains a matrix of longitudinal cell columns which in some cases extend across specific nuclear borders and may represent the basic thalamic building blocks in respect to the thalamo-cortical connexions.",

In the present study, WGA-HRP was injected into major subdivisions of the mediodorsal nucleus (MD) in the rhesus monkey in order to determine 1) The areal distribution of MD projections, 2) the layer(s) in which MD afferents terminate, 3) the tangential pattern of the MD axonal terminals, 4) the cells of origin of the reciprocal corticothalamic pathway, and 5) the degree of reciprocity between the corticothalamic and thalamocortical pathways in the different regions of the prefrontal cortex. As expected on the basis of retrograde degeneration and transport studies, injections centered in the magnocellular (MDmc) subnucleus of MD labeled cells and terminals in the ventral and medial prefrontal cortex. Injections involving ventral MDmc labeled the more lateral of these areas (Walker's areas 11 and 12); injections of the dorsal MDmc labeled the ventromedial regions (areas 13 and 14). In contrast, injections involving mainly the lateral, parvicellular (MDpc) moiety labeled cells and terminals in dorsolateral and dorsomedial areas (Walker's 46, 9, and 8B). Area 8A was labeled most prominently when injections included the multiform portion of MD (MDmf) and area 10 had connections with anterior portions of MD. A dorsal-ventral topography for MDpc exists with dorsal MDpc labeling dorsal and dorsomedial prefrontal areas and ventral MDpc labeling dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. Our findings with respect to MD are consistent with a nucleus-to-field organization of its thalamocortical projection system. Outside of the traditional boundaries of prefrontal cortex, lateral MD projections extended to the supplementary motor area (SMA) and the dorsal part of the anterior cingulate (AC) whereas the medial MD projection targeted the ventromedial cingulate cortex and spared SMA. In addition, a few labeled cells and sparse terminals were found in the inferior parietal lobule, the superior temporal sulcus, and the anterior part of the insula after injections that involved the medial part of MD. Labeled terminals were invariably confined to layer IV and adjacent deep layer III.

Comparison is made between the internal organisation of VI and VII cortex in terms of (1) the marked different in spiny and nonspiny neurons populations of granular layer 4, (2) the difference in relationship of lamina 6 pyramidal neurons to the overlying layers with a shift away from any relationship to granular layer 4 in VII, and (3) differences in the organization of VI lamina 4B and VII lamina 3B--both similarly placed, fiber-rich bands in the two cortical areas. The extrinsic relationships of VI and VII with the lateral geniculate nucleus, superior colliculus, pulvinar, peristriate cortex, cortical area STS, and with each other are compared in terms of laminar locations of efferent neurons and afferent axon terminal fields.

In monkeys, this neuronal group was further subdivided by 5-HT2C receptor mRNA expression.

The Nurr1(+)/CTGF(+) neurons coexpressed ER81 mRNA in monkeys but not in mice. On the basis of tracer injections in 3 monkeys, we found that the Nurr1(+) neurons in layer 6A send some corticocortical, but not corticopulvinar, projections. Although the Nurr1(+)/CTGF(-) neurons were restricted to lateral regions in the mouse cortex, they were present throughout the monkey cortex. Thus, an architectonic heterogeneity across areas and species was revealed for the neuronal subpopulations with distinct gene expression profiles.",

This review is intended to survey some of the basic anatomical features of columnar organization, and in particular the smaller scale dendritic minicolumns.

Although previous thalamostriatal studies emphasize projections from the intralaminar nuclei, studies in primates show a substantial projection from the ventral anterior (VA) and ventral lateral (VL) nuclei. These nuclei make up the main efferent projection from the basal ganglia to frontal cortical areas, including primary motor, supplementary, premotor, and cingulate motor areas. Functionally related motor areas of the frontal cortex and VA/VL have convergent projections to specific regions of the dorsal striatum. The distribution of VA/VL terminals within the striatum is crucial to understanding their relationship to motor cortical afferents. We placed anterograde tracer injections into discrete VA/VL thalamic areas. VA/VL thalamostriatal projections terminate in broad, rostrocaudal regions of the dorsal striatum, corresponding to regions innervated by functionally related cortical motor areas. The pars oralis division of VL projects primarily to the dorsolateral, postcommissural putamen, whereas the parvicellular VA targets more medial and rostral putamen regions, and the magnocellular division of VA targets the dorsal head of the caudate nucleus. Whereas these results demonstrate a general functional topography, specific VA/VL projections overlap extensively, suggesting that functionally distinct VA/VL projections may also converge in dorsal striatal areas. Within striatal territories, VA/VL projections terminate in a patchy, nonhomogeneous manner, indicating another level of complexity. Moreover, terminal fields contain both terminal clusters and scattered, long, unbranched fibers with many varicosities.

            "An understanding of the normal organization of prefrontal cortex is essential to the recognition of pathology underlying human behavioral disorders believed to depend on this region. We have therefore studied the pattern of intrinsic intra- and interlaminar pyramidal neuron connectivity in prefrontal areas 9 and 46 (of Walker) in macaque monkey cerebral cortex (anterior to the arcuate sulcus between the principal sulcus and midline). We made focal (200-400 microns) injections of biocytin and mapped the pattern of orthogradely transported label. Injections made into the superficial layers label wide-ranging lateral projections within the same areas of prefrontal cortex. Projections local to such small injections form a narrow band of terminals in layers 1-3 (200-400 microns wide, 2-4 mm long) centered on the injection site. Collateral fibers spread orthogonal to this terminal band, making frequent bifurcations, to establish a series of parallel bands of terminals with uninnervated bands between, spaced regularly across the cortex (center to center 500-600 microns). The entire pattern of terminal label is stripe-like, with occasional narrower interbands and crosslinks between the bands, and can extend over 7-8 mm across the cortex. These projections arise from pyramidal neurons in layers 2, 3, and 5 and terminate in layers 1-3. The stripe-like pattern contrasts with patch-like patterns in other cortical regions (V1, V2, V4, motor, somatosensory) and is smaller in scale than stripe-like zones of corticocortical afferent terminals to this region, reported to be 300-750 microns wide and spaced 1.0-1.5 mm center to center."

The present study examined the synaptic targets of the intrinsic axon collaterals arising from supragranular pyramidal neurons within the same stripe (local projections). Approximately 50% of the within-stripe axon terminals in monkey PFC area 9 targeted dendritic spines. In contrast, for both the intrinsic axon collaterals that travel between stripes (long-range projections), and the axon terminals that project to other PFC areas (associational projections), over 92% of the postsynaptic structures were dendritic spines (Melchitzky et al.

Dual-labeling studies confirmed that these within-stripe terminals contacted gamma-aminobutyric acid-immunoreactive dendritic shafts, including the subpopulation that contains the calcium-binding protein parvalbumin. The functional significance of the differences in synaptic targets between local and long-range intrinsic axon collaterals was supported by whole-cell, patch clamp recordings in an in vitro slice preparation of monkey PFC. Specifically, the small amplitude responses observed in layer 3 pyramidal neurons during long-range, low-intensity stimulation were exclusively excitatory, whereas local stimulation also evoked di/polysynaptic inhibitory responses. These anatomic and electrophysiological findings suggest that intrinsic connections of the PFC differ from other cortical regions and that within the PFC, feedback (within-stripe) inhibition plays a greater role in regulating the activity of supragranular pyramidal neurons than does feedforward inhibition either between stripes or across regions.",

To gain insight into the organization of these circuits, intracortical connections of major laminar and sublaminar divisions were retrogradely labeled in Walker's area 9 and 46 in rhesus monkeys by using cholera toxin (B-subunit) conjugated to colloidal gold. Microinjections placed within particular cortical laminae produced unique patterns of retrograde labeling. Injections in layers II/III yielded labeling which was laterally widespread (2-7 mm) in supragranular layers, and more narrowly focused, i.e., conforming to a column, in layers IV-VI. In contrast, local circuits associated with layers IV and Vb displayed a regular, cylindrical organization, whereas intrinsic connections of layer Va were laterally extensive (3-5 mm) in layers III and Va. Finally, injections in layer VI gave rise to a narrow column of cell labeling traversing all layers, augmented by laterally extensive labeling (approximately 7 mm) in layer VI. The intrinsic connections of the prefrontal cortex were arrayed within mediolaterally elongated stripes which were often distributed asymmetrically in either the medial or lateral direction. In addition, labeled cells within these mediolaterally oriented fields were frequently grouped within discrete clusters or narrow bands. The intrinsic connections identified in this study differ from the local circuits of corresponding layers reported for primary visual cortex; the unique intrinsic wiring diagram of the prefrontal cortex may be related to its specialized cognitive and mnemonic functions.",

            "Intrinsic connections are likely to play important roles in cognitive information processing in the prefrontal association cortex. To gain insight into the organization of these circuits, intracortical connections of major laminar and sublaminar divisions were retrogradely labeled in Walker's area 9 and 46 in rhesus monkeys by using cholera toxin (B-subunit) conjugated to colloidal gold. Microinjections placed within particular cortical laminae produced unique patterns of retrograde labeling. Injections in layers II/III yielded labeling which was laterally widespread (2-7 mm) in supragranular layers, and more narrowly focused, i.e., conforming to a column, in layers IV-VI. In contrast, local circuits associated with layers IV and Vb displayed a regular, cylindrical organization, whereas intrinsic connections of layer Va were laterally extensive (3-5 mm) in layers III and Va. Finally, injections in layer VI gave rise to a narrow column of cell labeling traversing all layers, augmented by laterally extensive labeling (approximately 7 mm) in layer VI. The intrinsic connections of the prefrontal cortex were arrayed within mediolaterally elongated stripes which were often distributed asymmetrically in either the medial or lateral direction. In addition, labeled cells within these mediolaterally oriented fields were frequently grouped within discrete clusters or narrow bands. The intrinsic connections identified in this study differ from the local circuits of corresponding layers reported for primary visual cortex; the unique intrinsic wiring diagram of the prefrontal cortex may be related to its specialized cognitive and mnemonic functions."

Retrogradely labeled cells were observed in several subcortical regions including the amygdaloid complex, claustrum, basal forebrain, thalamus, hypothalamus, and brainstem. In the amygdala, labeled cells were observed principally in the lateral nucleus, the accessory basal nucleus, the deep or paralaminar portion of the basal nucleus, and the periamygdaloid cortex. Additional retrogradely labeled cells were found in the endopiriform nucleus, the anterior amygdaloid area, and the cortical nuclei. Retrogradely labeled cells were observed throughout much of the rostrocaudal extent of the claustrum and tended to be located in its ventral half. In the basal forebrain, retrogradely labeled cells were observed in the medial septal nucleus, the nucleus of the diagonal band, and to lesser extent within the substantia innominata. Several of the cells in the latter region were large and located within the densely packed neuronal clusters of the basal nucleus of Meynert. Most of the labeled cells in the thalamus were located in the midline nuclei. Many were found in nucleus reuniens, but even greater numbers were located in the centralis complex. Additional labeled cells were located in the paraventricular and parataenial nuclei. In all cases, numerous retrogradely labeled cells were observed in the medial pulvinar. In the hypothalamus, most of the retrogradely labeled cells were located in the supramamillary area, though scattered cells were also observed in the perifornical region and in the lateral hypothalamic area. Caudal to the mamillary nuclei there were labeled cells in the ventral tegmental area. There were relatively few labeled cells in the brainstem and these were invariably located either in the raphe nuclei or locus coeruleus.",

Retrogradely labeled cells were observed in several subcortical regions including the amygdaloid complex, claustrum, basal forebrain, thalamus, hypothalamus, and brainstem. In the amygdala, labeled cells were observed principally in the lateral nucleus, the accessory basal nucleus, the deep or paralaminar portion of the basal nucleus, and the periamygdaloid cortex. Additional retrogradely labeled cells were found in the endopiriform nucleus, the anterior amygdaloid area, and the cortical nuclei. Retrogradely labeled cells were observed throughout much of the rostrocaudal extent of the claustrum and tended to be located in its ventral half. In the basal forebrain, retrogradely labeled cells were observed in the medial septal nucleus, the nucleus of the diagonal band, and to lesser extent within the substantia innominata. Several of the cells in the latter region were large and located within the densely packed neuronal clusters of the basal nucleus of Meynert. Most of the labeled cells in the thalamus were located in the midline nuclei. Many were found in nucleus reuniens, but even greater numbers were located in the centralis complex. Additional labeled cells were located in the paraventricular and parataenial nuclei. In all cases, numerous retrogradely labeled cells were observed in the medial pulvinar. In the hypothalamus, most of the retrogradely labeled cells were located in the supramamillary area, though scattered cells were also observed in the perifornical region and in the lateral hypothalamic area. Caudal to the mamillary nuclei there were labeled cells in the ventral tegmental area. There were relatively few labeled cells in the brainstem and these were invariably located either in the raphe nuclei or locus coeruleus."

            "BACKGROUND: The neocortical commissures have a fundamental role in functional integration across the cerebral hemispheres. We investigated whether commissural projections in prefrontal cortices are organized according to the same or different rules as those within the same hemisphere, by quantitatively comparing density, topography, and laminar origin of contralateral and ipsilateral projections, labeled after unilateral injection of retrograde tracers in prefrontal areas. RESULTS: Commissural projection neurons constituted less than one third of the ipsilateral. Nevertheless, projections from the two hemispheres were strongly correlated in topography and relative density. We investigated to what extent the distribution of contralateral projections depended on: (a) geographic proximity of projection areas to the area homotopic to the injection site; (b) the structural type of the linked areas, based on the number and neuronal density of their layers. Although both measures were good predictors, structural type was a comparatively stronger determinant of the relative distribution and density of projections. Ipsilateral projection neurons were distributed in the superficial (II-III) and deep (V-VI) layers, in proportions that varied across areas. In contrast, contralateral projection neurons were found mostly in the superficial layers, but still showed a gradient in their distribution within cortical layers that correlated significantly with cortical type, but not with geographic proximity to the homotopic area. CONCLUSION: The organization of ipsilateral and contralateral prefrontal projections is similar in topography and relative density, differing only by higher overall density and more widespread laminar origin of ipsilateral than contralateral projections. The projections on both sides are highly correlated with the structural architecture of the linked areas, and their remarkable organization is likely established by punctuated development of distinct cortical types. The preponderance of contralateral projections from layer III may be traced to the late development of the callosal system, whose function may be compromised in diseases that have their root late in ontogeny."

Both regions are characterized by structural heterogeneity, and include agranular, dysgranular and granular cortical types, denoting, respectively, the absence, incipience and presence of granular layer 4. In addition, both the prefrontal and anterior temporal cortices are composed of areas that have related though specialized functions. The pattern of cortical axonal termination was associated with both the structural type of the cortex of origin and the structure of the destination cortex. Thus, efferent fibers from a single origin in either prefrontal or anterior temporal cortex terminated in different patterns depending on their target area. Conversely, axons terminated in different patterns in a single target area, prefrontal or anterior temporal, depending on their area of origin. Projections from agranular or dysgranular type cortices (e.g. medial temporal areas and caudal orbitofrontal areas) terminated mostly in the upper layers of granular cortices (e.g. area TE and lateral prefrontal areas), and projections from granular cortices terminated mostly in the deep layers of agranular or dys- granular cortices. A robust projection from dysgranular orbitofrontal areas terminated in the deep layers of the agranular entorhinal cortex. Projections from prefrontal areas to area TE terminated in the upper layers, and may facilitate focused attention on behaviorally relevant stimuli processed through reciprocal pathways between prefrontal and temporal cortices.",

Both regions are characterized by structural heterogeneity, and include agranular, dysgranular and granular cortical types, denoting, respectively, the absence, incipience and presence of granular layer 4. In addition, both the prefrontal and anterior temporal cortices are composed of areas that have related though specialized functions. The pattern of cortical axonal termination was associated with both the structural type of the cortex of origin and the structure of the destination cortex. Thus, efferent fibers from a single origin in either prefrontal or anterior temporal cortex terminated in different patterns depending on their target area. Conversely, axons terminated in different patterns in a single target area, prefrontal or anterior temporal, depending on their area of origin. Projections from agranular or dysgranular type cortices (e.g. medial temporal areas and caudal orbitofrontal areas) terminated mostly in the upper layers of granular cortices (e.g. area TE and lateral prefrontal areas), and projections from granular cortices terminated mostly in the deep layers of agranular or dys- granular cortices. A robust projection from dysgranular orbitofrontal areas terminated in the deep layers of the agranular entorhinal cortex. Projections from prefrontal areas to area TE terminated in the upper layers, and may facilitate focused attention on behaviorally relevant stimuli processed through reciprocal pathways between prefrontal and temporal cortices."

            "Nonreciprocal feedback connections from ventromedial areas TE and TF have previously been reported to visual areas V1 and V2 (Kennedy and Bullier, 1985; Rockland and Van Hoesen, 1994). The present report confirms these earlier observations by utilizing anterograde label in conjunction with serial section analysis. Furthermore, it directly demonstrates the divergent configuration and range of these terminal fields. Thirteen axons were analyzed from ventromedial TE (4) or area TF (9) to occipitotemporal areas, and two from area TF to the upper bank of the intraparietal sulcus (IPS). All these axons have narrow, elongated fields that range from 4.0-21.0 mm. Terminations are distributed linearly along the axon or, in some cases, concentrated in irregularly spaced clusters. Most of these axons have terminations concentrated in layer 1. The two axons in the IPS have a bistratified terminal distribution (in layers 1-3 and 6) in their anterior field, but a distinctly different laminar pattern (with terminations concentrated in layer 1) in their distal 2.0 mm. These fields probably correspond to different areas, most likely MIP and PO. Axons projecting from higher order to early visual areas may contribute to extraperceptual, complex processes within area V1, such as activation in response to visual imagery, and are a possible substrate for synchronous linkage of spatially discrete assemblies of neurons. In summary, these results demonstrate 1) that some neurons in ventromedial TE and TF are in direct communication with early visual areas, including V1 and V2, and 2) that some feedback axons target several areas, sometimes with different laminar termination patterns. These results emphasize that cortical areas are interrelated by multiple direct and indirect pathways, not all of which are strictly hierarchical."

The hierarchical scheme of cortical processing assumes that prefrontal cortex issues 'feedback' projections to parietal cortex. However, the architectonic heterogeneity of these cortices raises the question of whether distinct areas have laminar-specific interconnections underlying their complex functional relationship. Using quantitative procedures, we showed that laminar-specific connections between distinct prefrontal (areas 46 and 8) and lateral intraparietal (LIPv, LIPd and 7a) areas in Macaca mulatta, studied with neural tracers, varied systematically according to rules determined by the laminar architecture of the linked areas. We found that axons from areas 46 and rostral 8 terminated heavily in layers I-III of all intraparietal areas, as did caudal area 8 to area LIPv, suggesting 'feedback' communication. However, contrary to previous assumptions, axons from caudal area 8 terminated mostly in layers IV-V of LIPd and 7a, suggesting 'feedforward' communication. These laminar patterns of connections were highly correlated with consistent differences in neuronal density between linked areas. When neuronal density in a prefrontal origin was lower than in the intraparietal destination, most terminations were found in layer I with a concomitant decrease in layer IV. The opposite occurred when the prefrontal origin had a higher neuronal density than the target.

A total of 305 connections among these 32 visual and visual-association areas have been reported. This represents 31% of the possible number of pathways if each area were connected with all others. The actual degree of connectivity is likely to be closer to 40%. The great majority of pathways involve reciprocal connections between areas. There are also extensive connections with cortical areas outside the visual system proper, including the somatosensory cortex, as well as neocortical, transitional, and archicortical regions in the temporal and frontal lobes. In the somatosensory/motor system, there are 62 identified pathways linking 13 cortical areas, suggesting an overall connectivity of about 40%. Based on the laminar patterns of connections between areas, we propose a hierarchy of visual areas and of somatosensory/motor areas that is more comprehensive than those suggested in other recent studies. The current version of the visual hierarchy includes 10 levels of cortical processing. Altogether, it contains 14 levels if one includes the retina and lateral geniculate nucleus at the bottom as well as the entorhinal cortex and hippocampus at the top. Within this hierarchy, there are multiple, intertwined processing streams, which, at a low level, are related to the compartmental organization of areas V1 and V2 and, at a high level, are related to the distinction between processing centers in the temporal and parietal lobes. However, there are some pathways and relationships (about 10% of the total) whose descriptions do not fit cleanly into this hierarchical scheme for one reason or another. In most instances, though, it is unclear whether these represent genuine exceptions to a strict hierarchy rather than inaccuracies or uncertainities in the reported assignment.",

The hierarchical scheme of cortical processing assumes that prefrontal cortex issues 'feedback' projections to parietal cortex. However, the architectonic heterogeneity of these cortices raises the question of whether distinct areas have laminar-specific interconnections underlying their complex functional relationship. Using quantitative procedures, we showed that laminar-specific connections between distinct prefrontal (areas 46 and 8) and lateral intraparietal (LIPv, LIPd and 7a) areas in Macaca mulatta, studied with neural tracers, varied systematically according to rules determined by the laminar architecture of the linked areas. We found that axons from areas 46 and rostral 8 terminated heavily in layers I-III of all intraparietal areas, as did caudal area 8 to area LIPv, suggesting 'feedback' communication. However, contrary to previous assumptions, axons from caudal area 8 terminated mostly in layers IV-V of LIPd and 7a, suggesting 'feedforward' communication. These laminar patterns of connections were highly correlated with consistent differences in neuronal density between linked areas. When neuronal density in a prefrontal origin was lower than in the intraparietal destination, most terminations were found in layer I with a concomitant decrease in layer IV. The opposite occurred when the prefrontal origin had a higher neuronal density than the target. These findings indicate that the neuronal density of linked areas can reliably predict their laminar connections and may form the basis of understanding the functional complexity of prefrontal-intraparietal interactions in cognition.",

In the monkey prefrontal cortex (PFC), horizontally oriented, intrinsic axon collaterals from supragranular pyramidal neurons form a series of stripe-like clusters of axon terminals (Levitt et al. [1993] J Comp Neurol 338:360-376; Pucak et al. [1996] J Comp Neurol 376:614-630). The present study examined the synaptic targets of the intrinsic axon collaterals arising from supragranular pyramidal neurons within the same stripe (local projections). Approximately 50% of the within-stripe axon terminals in monkey PFC area 9 targeted dendritic spines. In contrast, for both the intrinsic axon collaterals that travel between stripes (long-range projections), and the axon terminals that project to other PFC areas (associational projections), over 92% of the postsynaptic structures were dendritic spines (Melchitzky et al. [1998] J Comp Neurol 390:211-224). The other 50% of the within-stripe terminals synapsed with dendritic shafts. Dual-labeling studies confirmed that these within-stripe terminals contacted gamma-aminobutyric acid-immunoreactive dendritic shafts, including the subpopulation that contains the calcium-binding protein parvalbumin. The functional significance of the differences in synaptic targets between local and long-range intrinsic axon collaterals was supported by whole-cell, patch clamp recordings in an in vitro slice preparation of monkey PFC. Specifically, the small amplitude responses observed in layer 3 pyramidal neurons during long-range, low-intensity stimulation were exclusively excitatory, whereas local stimulation also evoked di/polysynaptic inhibitory responses. These anatomic and electrophysiological findings suggest that intrinsic connections of the PFC differ from other cortical regions and that within the PFC, feedback (within-stripe) inhibition plays a greater role in regulating the activity of supragranular pyramidal neurons than does feedforward inhibition either between stripes or across regions.",

These areas are richly interconnected by hundreds of reciprocal corticocortical pathways that underlie an anatomically based hierarchy containing multiple processing streams. In addition, there is a complex pattern of reciprocal connections with the pulvinar, which itself contains about 10 architectonically distinct subdivisions. Information flow through these corticocortical and corticothalamic circuits is regulated very dynamically by top-down as well as bottom-up processes, including directed visual attention. This chapter evaluates current hypotheses and evidence relating to the interaction between thalamocortical and corticocortical circuitry in the dynamic regulation of information flow.",

We report here on (1) a summary of the layout of cortical areas associated with vision and with other modalities, (2) a computerized database for storing and representing large amounts of information on connectivity patterns, and (3) the application of these data to the analysis of hierarchical organization of the cerebral cortex. Our analysis concentrates on the visual system, which includes 25 neocortical areas that are predominantly or exclusively visual in function, plus an additional 7 areas that we regard as visual-association areas on the basis of their extensive visual inputs. A total of 305 connections among these 32 visual and visual-association areas have been reported. This represents 31% of the possible number of pathways if each area were connected with all others. The actual degree of connectivity is likely to be closer to 40%. The great majority of pathways involve reciprocal connections between areas. There are also extensive connections with cortical areas outside the visual system proper, including the somatosensory cortex, as well as neocortical, transitional, and archicortical regions in the temporal and frontal lobes. In the somatosensory/motor system, there are 62 identified pathways linking 13 cortical areas, suggesting an overall connectivity of about 40%. Based on the laminar patterns of connections between areas, we propose a hierarchy of visual areas and of somatosensory/motor areas that is more comprehensive than those suggested in other recent studies. The current version of the visual hierarchy includes 10 levels of cortical processing. Altogether, it contains 14 levels if one includes the retina and lateral geniculate nucleus at the bottom as well as the entorhinal cortex and hippocampus at the top. Within this hierarchy, there are multiple, intertwined processing streams, which, at a low level, are related to the compartmental organization of areas V1 and V2 and, at a high level, are related to the distinction between processing centers in the temporal and parietal lobes. However, there are some pathways and relationships (about 10% of the total) whose descriptions do not fit cleanly into this hierarchical scheme for one reason or another. In most instances, though, it is unclear whether these represent genuine exceptions to a strict hierarchy rather than inaccuracies or uncertainities in the reported assignment.",

            "BACKGROUND: The neocortical commissures have a fundamental role in functional integration across the cerebral hemispheres. We investigated whether commissural projections in prefrontal cortices are organized according to the same or different rules as those within the same hemisphere, by quantitatively comparing density, topography, and laminar origin of contralateral and ipsilateral projections, labeled after unilateral injection of retrograde tracers in prefrontal areas. RESULTS: Commissural projection neurons constituted less than one third of the ipsilateral. Nevertheless, projections from the two hemispheres were strongly correlated in topography and relative density. We investigated to what extent the distribution of contralateral projections depended on: (a) geographic proximity of projection areas to the area homotopic to the injection site; (b) the structural type of the linked areas, based on the number and neuronal density of their layers. Although both measures were good predictors, structural type was a comparatively stronger determinant of the relative distribution and density of projections. Ipsilateral projection neurons were distributed in the superficial (II-III) and deep (V-VI) layers, in proportions that varied across areas. In contrast, contralateral projection neurons were found mostly in the superficial layers, but still showed a gradient in their distribution within cortical layers that correlated significantly with cortical type, but not with geographic proximity to the homotopic area. CONCLUSION: The organization of ipsilateral and contralateral prefrontal projections is similar in topography and relative density, differing only by higher overall density and more widespread laminar origin of ipsilateral than contralateral projections. The projections on both sides are highly correlated with the structural architecture of the linked areas, and their remarkable organization is likely established by punctuated development of distinct cortical types. The preponderance of contralateral projections from layer III may be traced to the late development of the callosal system, whose function may be compromised in diseases that have their root late in ontogeny."

The projections on both sides are highly correlated with the structural architecture of the linked areas, and their remarkable organization is likely established by punctuated development of distinct cortical types. The preponderance of contralateral projections from layer III may be traced to the late development of the callosal system, whose function may be compromised in diseases that have their root late in ontogeny."

            "BACKGROUND: The neocortical commissures have a fundamental role in functional integration across the cerebral hemispheres. We investigated whether commissural projections in prefrontal cortices are organized according to the same or different rules as those within the same hemisphere, by quantitatively comparing density, topography, and laminar origin of contralateral and ipsilateral projections, labeled after unilateral injection of retrograde tracers in prefrontal areas. RESULTS: Commissural projection neurons constituted less than one third of the ipsilateral. Nevertheless, projections from the two hemispheres were strongly correlated in topography and relative density. We investigated to what extent the distribution of contralateral projections depended on: (a) geographic proximity of projection areas to the area homotopic to the injection site; (b) the structural type of the linked areas, based on the number and neuronal density of their layers. Although both measures were good predictors, structural type was a comparatively stronger determinant of the relative distribution and density of projections. Ipsilateral projection neurons were distributed in the superficial (II-III) and deep (V-VI) layers, in proportions that varied across areas. In contrast, contralateral projection neurons were found mostly in the superficial layers, but still showed a gradient in their distribution within cortical layers that correlated significantly with cortical type, but not with geographic proximity to the homotopic area. CONCLUSION: The organization of ipsilateral and contralateral prefrontal projections is similar in topography and relative density, differing only by higher overall density and more widespread laminar origin of ipsilateral than contralateral projections. The projections on both sides are highly correlated with the structural architecture of the linked areas, and their remarkable organization is likely established by punctuated development of distinct cortical types. The preponderance of contralateral projections from layer III may be traced to the late development of the callosal system, whose function may be compromised in diseases that have their root late in ontogeny."

            "The laminar origin of cortical projections to the frontal cortex was studied in 17 adult rhesus monkeys with the use of the retrograde transport of horseradish peroxidase (HRP). The frontal regions injected with HRP extended from the posterior periarcuate region to the frontal pole. The architectonic boundaries of areas containing HRP-labeled neurons were determined from matched sections stained for the visualization of cell bodies, myelin, or acetylcholinesterase. The results showed that the laminar origin of both nearby and distant corticocortical projections was correlated with the architectonic differentiation of the regions giving rise to the projecting afferent fibers. Frontally directed projections from limbic cortices, which show a rudimentary laminar organization, emanated mainly from deep layers. On the other hand, projections from increasingly more differentiated cortices arose progressively from the upper (or supragranular) layers. This pattern was observed for projections originating along the axis of architectonic differentiation of the visual, somatosensory, auditory, motor, and prefrontal cortical systems. Thus, as the cortical architecture within each system changes from limbic areas toward the primary cortices, the origin of frontally directed projections shifts from predominantly infragranular to predominantly supragranular layers."

Finally, differences in the dendritic morphology of callosal and ipsilateral neurons have implications for understanding the functional attributes of these two populations of cells, as well as for the characterization of pyramidal neurons in human disease states."

Microinjections placed within particular cortical laminae produced unique patterns of retrograde labeling. Injections in layers II/III yielded labeling which was laterally widespread (2-7 mm) in supragranular layers, and more narrowly focused, i.e., conforming to a column, in layers IV-VI. In contrast, local circuits associated with layers IV and Vb displayed a regular, cylindrical organization, whereas intrinsic connections of layer Va were laterally extensive (3-5 mm) in layers III and Va. Finally, injections in layer VI gave rise to a narrow column of cell labeling traversing all layers, augmented by laterally extensive labeling (approximately 7 mm) in layer VI. The intrinsic connections of the prefrontal cortex were arrayed within mediolaterally elongated stripes which were often distributed asymmetrically in either the medial or lateral direction. In addition, labeled cells within these mediolaterally oriented fields were frequently grouped within discrete clusters or narrow bands. The intrinsic connections identified in this study differ from the local circuits of corresponding layers reported for primary visual cortex; the unique intrinsic wiring diagram of the prefrontal cortex may be related to its specialized cognitive and mnemonic functions.",

In contrast, local circuits associated with layers IV and Vb displayed a regular, cylindrical organization, whereas intrinsic connections of layer Va were laterally extensive (3-5 mm) in layers III and Va. Finally, injections in layer VI gave rise to a narrow column of cell labeling traversing all layers, augmented by laterally extensive labeling (approximately 7 mm) in layer VI. The intrinsic connections of the prefrontal cortex were arrayed within mediolaterally elongated stripes which were often distributed asymmetrically in either the medial or lateral direction. In addition, labeled cells within these mediolaterally oriented fields were frequently grouped within discrete clusters or narrow bands.

Analysis was focused mainly on the dorsal part of area TE, in which a functional columnar organization has been shown. Interlaminar connections were analyzed in coronal section after laminar-specific microinjections, and intralaminar connections were examined from tangential sections. After injections at various depths in the dorsal TE, both axons and cell bodies were strongly labeled above or below the injection site in a columnar appearance. Axons from layer 3 ran in bundles towards the white matter and gave off prominent collaterals in layer 5. Ascending axons from lower to upper layers were also present (e.g., layers 4, 5, and 6 to layer 3). In tangential sections, there were abundant axons running parallel to the pia mater. These horizontal axons, particularly those in layers 2 and 3, produced patches of terminals 0.5 +/- 0.1 mm (mean +/- s.d.) in size and cylindrical in shape, spanning layers 1-3 or even to layers 4 and 5. In the tangential plane, they were distributed in an anisotropic manner around the injection. The farthest patch appeared at 4 mm from the injection site. The center-to-center distance between nearest-neighbor patches was 0.7 +/- 0.3 mm. These patches were found only within the dorsal TE and did not extend into the lower bank of the superior temporal sulcus or into the ventral part of area TE. Area TEO, which is a major afferent source to area TE, had axonal patches with spacing similar to those in area TE but with smaller sizes (0.4 +/- 0.1 mm). The results show that intrinsic horizontal axons both in area TE and in area TEO arborize in a patchy manner, as has been reported for several other cortical areas. In are TE, the size and spacing of the terminal patches match those of columns with similar stimulus selectivity. Thus, these patches may be related to the functional modularity in area TE.

            "BACKGROUND: The neocortical commissures have a fundamental role in functional integration across the cerebral hemispheres. We investigated whether commissural projections in prefrontal cortices are organized according to the same or different rules as those within the same hemisphere, by quantitatively comparing density, topography, and laminar origin of contralateral and ipsilateral projections, labeled after unilateral injection of retrograde tracers in prefrontal areas. RESULTS: Commissural projection neurons constituted less than one third of the ipsilateral. Nevertheless, projections from the two hemispheres were strongly correlated in topography and relative density. We investigated to what extent the distribution of contralateral projections depended on: (a) geographic proximity of projection areas to the area homotopic to the injection site; (b) the structural type of the linked areas, based on the number and neuronal density of their layers. Although both measures were good predictors, structural type was a comparatively stronger determinant of the relative distribution and density of projections. Ipsilateral projection neurons were distributed in the superficial (II-III) and deep (V-VI) layers, in proportions that varied across areas. In contrast, contralateral projection neurons were found mostly in the superficial layers, but still showed a gradient in their distribution within cortical layers that correlated significantly with cortical type, but not with geographic proximity to the homotopic area. CONCLUSION: The organization of ipsilateral and contralateral prefrontal projections is similar in topography and relative density, differing only by higher overall density and more widespread laminar origin of ipsilateral than contralateral projections. The projections on both sides are highly correlated with the structural architecture of the linked areas, and their remarkable organization is likely established by punctuated development of distinct cortical types. The preponderance of contralateral projections from layer III may be traced to the late development of the callosal system, whose function may be compromised in diseases that have their root late in ontogeny."

The area chosen for study is located between the cingulate gyrus and the ventral bank of the principal sulcus, and contains areas 9 and 46 as described by Walker (J. Comp. Neurol. 73:59-86, '40). In Golgi studies, the unique axonal features of impregnated neurons made possible the identification of thirteen separate classes of local circuit neurons. Five of these cell types, in their general characteristics, resembled classes identified in human prefrontal cortex, as well as in other cortical areas of macaque monkeys and other species. Measurements of the scale of axon arbors and dendritic fields of the Golgi-stained local circuit neurons also suggested particular spatial relationships of certain classes to the scale of intrinsic lattice connections made by the axons of pyramidal neurons in the same region. Similarities in morphology between cells described in human prefrontal cortex and neuron varieties described in this study indicate that this region of monkey prefrontal cortex may serve as a useful model for neuron populations in human prefrontal cortex. Sufficient morphological detail was present in immunocytochemical studies to suggest one or more identifying biochemical characteristics for seven of the thirteen classes of local circuit neurons. The calcium binding proteins, parvalbumin, calbindin D-28K, and calretinin, were found in chandelier and wide arbor neurons, neurogliaform cells, and double bouquet neurons, respectively. In addition, cholecystokinin immunoreactivity was present in medium arbor neurons and in narrow arbor cells connecting layers 2 and 4. Somatostatin 28(1-12) immunoreactivity was detected in beaded axon neurons in layers 5 and 6. This biochemical characterization of local circuit neurons, although incomplete, confirms the separate identity of at least some of the varieties distinguished by Golgi morphology, and allows a start to be made on studies examining changes in their functional state. The general inhibitory nature of these interneurons suggests that they are likely to play a crucial role in determining patterns of neural activation in the prefrontal cortex.",

            "A study has been made of the nonpyramidal, local circuit neurons in developing and mature macaque monkey prefrontal cortex with Golgi and immunocytochemical techniques. The area chosen for study is located between the cingulate gyrus and the ventral bank of the principal sulcus, and contains areas 9 and 46 as described by Walker (J. Comp. Neurol. 73:59-86, '40). In Golgi studies, the unique axonal features of impregnated neurons made possible the identification of thirteen separate classes of local circuit neurons. Five of these cell types, in their general characteristics, resembled classes identified in human prefrontal cortex, as well as in other cortical areas of macaque monkeys and other species. Measurements of the scale of axon arbors and dendritic fields of the Golgi-stained local circuit neurons also suggested particular spatial relationships of certain classes to the scale of intrinsic lattice connections made by the axons of pyramidal neurons in the same region. Similarities in morphology between cells described in human prefrontal cortex and neuron varieties described in this study indicate that this region of monkey prefrontal cortex may serve as a useful model for neuron populations in human prefrontal cortex. Sufficient morphological detail was present in immunocytochemical studies to suggest one or more identifying biochemical characteristics for seven of the thirteen classes of local circuit neurons. The calcium binding proteins, parvalbumin, calbindin D-28K, and calretinin, were found in chandelier and wide arbor neurons, neurogliaform cells, and double bouquet neurons, respectively. In addition, cholecystokinin immunoreactivity was present in medium arbor neurons and in narrow arbor cells connecting layers 2 and 4. Somatostatin 28(1-12) immunoreactivity was detected in beaded axon neurons in layers 5 and 6. This biochemical characterization of local circuit neurons, although incomplete, confirms the separate identity of at least some of the varieties distinguished by Golgi morphology, and allows a start to be made on studies examining changes in their functional state. The general inhibitory nature of these interneurons suggests that they are likely to play a crucial role in determining patterns of neural activation in the prefrontal cortex."

Interneurons were also identified using GABA immunocytochemistry. The areal and laminar distributions of CR, PV, and CB cells were consistent across mPFC; their morphological characteristics identified them as local circuit neurons.

In addition, some cells in layer 1 (including Cajal-Retzius neurons) were CR immunoreactive. Calbindin immunoreactivity also labelled a population of large nonpyramidal neurons deep in the cortex. Other types of CR, PV and CB cells were also immunolabelled. A small population of layer 3 pyramidal cells was weakly CB immunoreactive. Peak cell densities occurred in layer 2/upper layer 3 for CR+ neurons and in upper to midlayer 3 for CB+ cells. PV+ neuron density peaked in midcortex. These observations support and extend a similar study of monkey prefrontal cortex (Conde et al. [1994] J. Comp. Neurol. 341:95-116). The morphologies and combined cortical depth distributions of CR+, PV+, and CB+ neurons were similar to GABA-immunolabelled cells. Local circuit neurons in mPFC displaying NADPH diaphorase activity composed less than 0.25% of the total neuron population, and were distributed in two horizontal strata, in mid- to lower layer 3 and in lower layer 5/upper layer 6. CR, PV and CB immunoreactivity was colocalised in NADPH diaphorase-reactive neurons. The interrelationships between CR+, PV+ and CB+ neurons were investigated using dual immunocytochemistry. CR+ puncta were found to be closely associated with the cell bodies and proximal processes of PV+ neurons, whereas CR+ puncta were located more distally over processes from CB+ cells. Additionally, PV+ puncta were found closely apposed to PV+ somata and processes and CR+ puncta abutted against CR+ cell bodies. The companion paper (Gabbott and Bacon [1996] J. Comp.

            "A study has been made of the nonpyramidal, local circuit neurons in developing and mature macaque monkey prefrontal cortex with Golgi and immunocytochemical techniques. The area chosen for study is located between the cingulate gyrus and the ventral bank of the principal sulcus, and contains areas 9 and 46 as described by Walker (J. Comp. Neurol. 73:59-86, '40). In Golgi studies, the unique axonal features of impregnated neurons made possible the identification of thirteen separate classes of local circuit neurons. Five of these cell types, in their general characteristics, resembled classes identified in human prefrontal cortex, as well as in other cortical areas of macaque monkeys and other species. Measurements of the scale of axon arbors and dendritic fields of the Golgi-stained local circuit neurons also suggested particular spatial relationships of certain classes to the scale of intrinsic lattice connections made by the axons of pyramidal neurons in the same region. Similarities in morphology between cells described in human prefrontal cortex and neuron varieties described in this study indicate that this region of monkey prefrontal cortex may serve as a useful model for neuron populations in human prefrontal cortex. Sufficient morphological detail was present in immunocytochemical studies to suggest one or more identifying biochemical characteristics for seven of the thirteen classes of local circuit neurons. The calcium binding proteins, parvalbumin, calbindin D-28K, and calretinin, were found in chandelier and wide arbor neurons, neurogliaform cells, and double bouquet neurons, respectively. In addition, cholecystokinin immunoreactivity was present in medium arbor neurons and in narrow arbor cells connecting layers 2 and 4. Somatostatin 28(1-12) immunoreactivity was detected in beaded axon neurons in layers 5 and 6. This biochemical characterization of local circuit neurons, although incomplete, confirms the separate identity of at least some of the varieties distinguished by Golgi morphology, and allows a start to be made on studies examining changes in their functional state.

The calcium-binding proteins, calretinin, calbindin, and parvalbumin, are expressed in a variety of cortical local circuit neurons. However, in the primate prefrontal cortex, relatively little is known, especially with regard to calretinin, about the specific classes or distribution of local circuit neurons that contain these calcium-binding proteins. In this study, we used immunohistochemical techniques to characterize and compare the morphological features and distribution in macaque monkey prefrontal cortex of local circuit neurons that contain each of these calcium-binding proteins. On the basis of the axonal features of the labeled neurons, and correlations with previous Golgi studies, calretinin appeared to be present in double-bouquet neurons, calbindin in neurogliaform neurons and Martinotti cells, and parvalbumin in chandelier and wide arbor (basket) neurons. Calretinin was also found in other cell populations, such as a distinctive group of large neurons in the infragranular layers, but it was not possible to assign these neurons to a known cell class. In addition, although the animals studied were adults, immunoreactivity for both calretinin and calbindin was found in Cajal-Retzius neurons of layer I. Dual labeling studies confirmed that with the exception of the Cajal-Retzius neurons, each calcium-binding protein was expressed in separate populations of prefrontal cortical neurons. Comparisons of the laminar distributions of the labeled neurons also indicated that these calcium-binding proteins were segregated into discrete neuronal populations. Calretinin-positive neurons were present in greatest density in deep layer I and layer II, calbindin-immunoreactive cells were most dense in layers II-superficial III, and parvalbumin-containing neurons were present in greatest density in the middle cortical layers. In addition, the relative density of calretinin-labeled neurons was approximately twice that of the calbindin- and parvalbumin-positive neurons. However, within each group of labeled neurons, their laminar distribution and relative density did not differ substantially across regions of the prefrontal cortex. These findings demonstrate that calretinin, calbindin, and parvalbumin are markers of separate populations of local circuit neurons in monkey prefrontal cortex, and that they may be useful tools in unraveling the intrinsic inhibitory circuitry of the primate prefrontal cortex in but normal and disease states.",

Cortical interneurons were identified immunocytochemically by the expression of the calcium binding proteins calretinin (CR), parvalbumin (PV) and calbindin D-28k (CB). Interneurons were also identified using GABA immunocytochemistry. The areal and laminar distributions of CR, PV, and CB cells were consistent across mPFC; their morphological characteristics identified them as local circuit neurons. Throughout layers 2-6: CR immunoreactivity labelled double bouquet and bipolar neurons, PV was localised in large and small basket neurons and in chandelier (axoaxonic) cells, while CB immunoreactivity was present in double bouquet, Martinotti, and neurogliaform neurons. In addition, some cells in layer 1 (including Cajal-Retzius neurons) were CR immunoreactive. Calbindin immunoreactivity also labelled a population of large nonpyramidal neurons deep in the cortex. Other types of CR, PV and CB cells were also immunolabelled. A small population of layer 3 pyramidal cells was weakly CB immunoreactive. Peak cell densities occurred in layer 2/upper layer 3 for CR+ neurons and in upper to midlayer 3 for CB+ cells. PV+ neuron density peaked in midcortex. These observations support and extend a similar study of monkey prefrontal cortex (Conde et al. [1994] J. Comp. Neurol. 341:95-116). The morphologies and combined cortical depth distributions of CR+, PV+, and CB+ neurons were similar to GABA-immunolabelled cells. Local circuit neurons in mPFC displaying NADPH diaphorase activity composed less than 0.25% of the total neuron population, and were distributed in two horizontal strata, in mid- to lower layer 3 and in lower layer 5/upper layer 6. CR, PV and CB immunoreactivity was colocalised in NADPH diaphorase-reactive neurons. The interrelationships between CR+, PV+ and CB+ neurons were investigated using dual immunocytochemistry. CR+ puncta were found to be closely associated with the cell bodies and proximal processes of PV+ neurons, whereas CR+ puncta were located more distally over processes from CB+ cells. Additionally, PV+ puncta were found closely apposed to PV+ somata and processes and CR+ puncta abutted against CR+ cell bodies. The companion paper (Gabbott and Bacon [1996] J. Comp.

            "A study has been made of the nonpyramidal, local circuit neurons in developing and mature macaque monkey prefrontal cortex with Golgi and immunocytochemical techniques. The area chosen for study is located between the cingulate gyrus and the ventral bank of the principal sulcus, and contains areas 9 and 46 as described by Walker (J. Comp. Neurol. 73:59-86, '40). In Golgi studies, the unique axonal features of impregnated neurons made possible the identification of thirteen separate classes of local circuit neurons. Five of these cell types, in their general characteristics, resembled classes identified in human prefrontal cortex, as well as in other cortical areas of macaque monkeys and other species. Measurements of the scale of axon arbors and dendritic fields of the Golgi-stained local circuit neurons also suggested particular spatial relationships of certain classes to the scale of intrinsic lattice connections made by the axons of pyramidal neurons in the same region. Similarities in morphology between cells described in human prefrontal cortex and neuron varieties described in this study indicate that this region of monkey prefrontal cortex may serve as a useful model for neuron populations in human prefrontal cortex. Sufficient morphological detail was present in immunocytochemical studies to suggest one or more identifying biochemical characteristics for seven of the thirteen classes of local circuit neurons. The calcium binding proteins, parvalbumin, calbindin D-28K, and calretinin, were found in chandelier and wide arbor neurons, neurogliaform cells, and double bouquet neurons, respectively. In addition, cholecystokinin immunoreactivity was present in medium arbor neurons and in narrow arbor cells connecting layers 2 and 4. Somatostatin 28(1-12) immunoreactivity was detected in beaded axon neurons in layers 5 and 6. This biochemical characterization of local circuit neurons, although incomplete, confirms the separate identity of at least some of the varieties distinguished by Golgi morphology, and allows a start to be made on studies examining changes in their functional state. The general inhibitory nature of these interneurons suggests that they are likely to play a crucial role in determining patterns of neural activation in the prefrontal cortex."

However, in the primate prefrontal cortex, relatively little is known, especially with regard to calretinin, about the specific classes or distribution of local circuit neurons that contain these calcium-binding proteins. In this study, we used immunohistochemical techniques to characterize and compare the morphological features and distribution in macaque monkey prefrontal cortex of local circuit neurons that contain each of these calcium-binding proteins. On the basis of the axonal features of the labeled neurons, and correlations with previous Golgi studies, calretinin appeared to be present in double-bouquet neurons, calbindin in neurogliaform neurons and Martinotti cells, and parvalbumin in chandelier and wide arbor (basket) neurons. Calretinin was also found in other cell populations, such as a distinctive group of large neurons in the infragranular layers, but it was not possible to assign these neurons to a known cell class. In addition, although the animals studied were adults, immunoreactivity for both calretinin and calbindin was found in Cajal-Retzius neurons of layer I. Dual labeling studies confirmed that with the exception of the Cajal-Retzius neurons, each calcium-binding protein was expressed in separate populations of prefrontal cortical neurons. Comparisons of the laminar distributions of the labeled neurons also indicated that these calcium-binding proteins were segregated into discrete neuronal populations. Calretinin-positive neurons were present in greatest density in deep layer I and layer II, calbindin-immunoreactive cells were most dense in layers II-superficial III, and parvalbumin-containing neurons were present in greatest density in the middle cortical layers. In addition, the relative density of calretinin-labeled neurons was approximately twice that of the calbindin- and parvalbumin-positive neurons. However, within each group of labeled neurons, their laminar distribution and relative density did not differ substantially across regions of the prefrontal cortex.

Interareal differences were not significant. Cortical depth measurements and neuronal NV estimates for each area allowed the absolute number of neurons in a column of cortex under 1 mm2 of surface to be calculated; values varied between 86,457 +/- 15,063 (area 24a) and 128,464 +/- 24,050 (area 24c).

Peaks in the cortical depth distributions of CR+ and CB+ neurons occurred in layer 2 and upper layer 3, respectively; the peak distribution of PV+ neurons occurred between lower layer 3 and upper layer 5. The depth distribution of GABA+ cells reflected the combined distributions of CR+, PV+ and CR+ neurons. In all areas, the majority (74.4-84.0%) of the GABA cell population was located in layers 2/3.

The classification of interneurons in the primate neocortex is further complicated by a less extensive database of the features of these neurons and by reported interspecies differences. Consequently, in this study we characterized 8 different morphological types of interneurons from monkey prefrontal cortex, 4 of which have not been previously classified. These interneuron types differed in their expression of molecular markers and clustered into 3 different electrophysiological classes. The first class consisted of fast-spiking parvalbumin-positive chandelier and linear arbor cells. The second class comprised 5 different morphological types of continuous-adapting calretinin- or calbindin-positive interneurons that had the lowest level of firing threshold. However, 2 of these morphological types had short spike duration, which is not typical for rodent adapting cells. Neurogliaform cells (NGFCs), which coexpressed calbindin and neuropeptide Y, formed the third class, characterized by strong initial adaptation. They did not exhibit the delayed spikes seen in rodent NGFCs. These results indicate that primate interneurons have some specific properties; consequently, direct translation of classification schemes developed from studies in rodents to primates might be inappropriate.",

        "pm_abstract": "This paper provides a comprehensive morphological description of local circuit neurons in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC: areas 24a, 24b, 24c, 25 and 32) of the monkey. Cortical interneurons were identified immunocytochemically by the expression of the calcium binding proteins calretinin (CR), parvalbumin (PV) and calbindin D-28k (CB). Interneurons were also identified using GABA immunocytochemistry. The areal and laminar distributions of CR, PV, and CB cells were consistent across mPFC; their morphological characteristics identified them as local circuit neurons. Throughout layers 2-6: CR immunoreactivity labelled double bouquet and bipolar neurons, PV was localised in large and small basket neurons and in chandelier (axoaxonic) cells, while CB immunoreactivity was present in double bouquet, Martinotti, and neurogliaform neurons. In addition, some cells in layer 1 (including Cajal-Retzius neurons) were CR immunoreactive. Calbindin immunoreactivity also labelled a population of large nonpyramidal neurons deep in the cortex. Other types of CR, PV and CB cells were also immunolabelled. A small population of layer 3 pyramidal cells was weakly CB immunoreactive. Peak cell densities occurred in layer 2/upper layer 3 for CR+ neurons and in upper to midlayer 3 for CB+ cells. PV+ neuron density peaked in midcortex. These observations support and extend a similar study of monkey prefrontal cortex (Conde et al. [1994] J. Comp. Neurol. 341:95-116). The morphologies and combined cortical depth distributions of CR+, PV+, and CB+ neurons were similar to GABA-immunolabelled cells. Local circuit neurons in mPFC displaying NADPH diaphorase activity composed less than 0.25% of the total neuron population, and were distributed in two horizontal strata, in mid- to lower layer 3 and in lower layer 5/upper layer 6. CR, PV and CB immunoreactivity was colocalised in NADPH diaphorase-reactive neurons. The interrelationships between CR+, PV+ and CB+ neurons were investigated using dual immunocytochemistry. CR+ puncta were found to be closely associated with the cell bodies and proximal processes of PV+ neurons, whereas CR+ puncta were located more distally over processes from CB+ cells. Additionally, PV+ puncta were found closely apposed to PV+ somata and processes and CR+ puncta abutted against CR+ cell bodies. The companion paper (Gabbott and Bacon [1996] J. Comp. Neurol.) presents quantitative data regarding the areal and laminar distributions of the identified cell classes in mPFC. Such data provide a realistic structural framework with which to investigate neuronal operations in monkey mPFC.",

            "This paper provides a comprehensive morphological description of local circuit neurons in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC: areas 24a, 24b, 24c, 25 and 32) of the monkey. Cortical interneurons were identified immunocytochemically by the expression of the calcium binding proteins calretinin (CR), parvalbumin (PV) and calbindin D-28k (CB). Interneurons were also identified using GABA immunocytochemistry. The areal and laminar distributions of CR, PV, and CB cells were consistent across mPFC; their morphological characteristics identified them as local circuit neurons. Throughout layers 2-6: CR immunoreactivity labelled double bouquet and bipolar neurons, PV was localised in large and small basket neurons and in chandelier (axoaxonic) cells, while CB immunoreactivity was present in double bouquet, Martinotti, and neurogliaform neurons. In addition, some cells in layer 1 (including Cajal-Retzius neurons) were CR immunoreactive. Calbindin immunoreactivity also labelled a population of large nonpyramidal neurons deep in the cortex. Other types of CR, PV and CB cells were also immunolabelled. A small population of layer 3 pyramidal cells was weakly CB immunoreactive. Peak cell densities occurred in layer 2/upper layer 3 for CR+ neurons and in upper to midlayer 3 for CB+ cells. PV+ neuron density peaked in midcortex. These observations support and extend a similar study of monkey prefrontal cortex (Conde et al. [1994] J. Comp. Neurol. 341:95-116). The morphologies and combined cortical depth distributions of CR+, PV+, and CB+ neurons were similar to GABA-immunolabelled cells. Local circuit neurons in mPFC displaying NADPH diaphorase activity composed less than 0.25% of the total neuron population, and were distributed in two horizontal strata, in mid- to lower layer 3 and in lower layer 5/upper layer 6. CR, PV and CB immunoreactivity was colocalised in NADPH diaphorase-reactive neurons. The interrelationships between CR+, PV+ and CB+ neurons were investigated using dual immunocytochemistry. CR+ puncta were found to be closely associated with the cell bodies and proximal processes of PV+ neurons, whereas CR+ puncta were located more distally over processes from CB+ cells. Additionally, PV+ puncta were found closely apposed to PV+ somata and processes and CR+ puncta abutted against CR+ cell bodies. The companion paper (Gabbott and Bacon [1996] J. Comp. Neurol.) presents quantitative data regarding the areal and laminar distributions of the identified cell classes in mPFC. Such data provide a realistic structural framework with which to investigate neuronal operations in monkey mPFC."

            "A study has been made of the nonpyramidal, local circuit neurons in developing and mature macaque monkey prefrontal cortex with Golgi and immunocytochemical techniques. The area chosen for study is located between the cingulate gyrus and the ventral bank of the principal sulcus, and contains areas 9 and 46 as described by Walker (J. Comp. Neurol. 73:59-86, '40). In Golgi studies, the unique axonal features of impregnated neurons made possible the identification of thirteen separate classes of local circuit neurons. Five of these cell types, in their general characteristics, resembled classes identified in human prefrontal cortex, as well as in other cortical areas of macaque monkeys and other species. Measurements of the scale of axon arbors and dendritic fields of the Golgi-stained local circuit neurons also suggested particular spatial relationships of certain classes to the scale of intrinsic lattice connections made by the axons of pyramidal neurons in the same region. Similarities in morphology between cells described in human prefrontal cortex and neuron varieties described in this study indicate that this region of monkey prefrontal cortex may serve as a useful model for neuron populations in human prefrontal cortex. Sufficient morphological detail was present in immunocytochemical studies to suggest one or more identifying biochemical characteristics for seven of the thirteen classes of local circuit neurons. The calcium binding proteins, parvalbumin, calbindin D-28K, and calretinin, were found in chandelier and wide arbor neurons, neurogliaform cells, and double bouquet neurons, respectively. In addition, cholecystokinin immunoreactivity was present in medium arbor neurons and in narrow arbor cells connecting layers 2 and 4. Somatostatin 28(1-12) immunoreactivity was detected in beaded axon neurons in layers 5 and 6. This biochemical characterization of local circuit neurons, although incomplete, confirms the separate identity of at least some of the varieties distinguished by Golgi morphology, and allows a start to be made on studies examining changes in their functional state. The general inhibitory nature of these interneurons suggests that they are likely to play a crucial role in determining patterns of neural activation in the prefrontal cortex."

The calcium-binding proteins, calretinin, calbindin, and parvalbumin, are expressed in a variety of cortical local circuit neurons. However, in the primate prefrontal cortex, relatively little is known, especially with regard to calretinin, about the specific classes or distribution of local circuit neurons that contain these calcium-binding proteins. In this study, we used immunohistochemical techniques to characterize and compare the morphological features and distribution in macaque monkey prefrontal cortex of local circuit neurons that contain each of these calcium-binding proteins. On the basis of the axonal features of the labeled neurons, and correlations with previous Golgi studies, calretinin appeared to be present in double-bouquet neurons, calbindin in neurogliaform neurons and Martinotti cells, and parvalbumin in chandelier and wide arbor (basket) neurons. Calretinin was also found in other cell populations, such as a distinctive group of large neurons in the infragranular layers, but it was not possible to assign these neurons to a known cell class. In addition, although the animals studied were adults, immunoreactivity for both calretinin and calbindin was found in Cajal-Retzius neurons of layer I. Dual labeling studies confirmed that with the exception of the Cajal-Retzius neurons, each calcium-binding protein was expressed in separate populations of prefrontal cortical neurons. Comparisons of the laminar distributions of the labeled neurons also indicated that these calcium-binding proteins were segregated into discrete neuronal populations. Calretinin-positive neurons were present in greatest density in deep layer I and layer II, calbindin-immunoreactive cells were most dense in layers II-superficial III, and parvalbumin-containing neurons were present in greatest density in the middle cortical layers. In addition, the relative density of calretinin-labeled neurons was approximately twice that of the calbindin- and parvalbumin-positive neurons. However, within each group of labeled neurons, their laminar distribution and relative density did not differ substantially across regions of the prefrontal cortex. These findings demonstrate that calretinin, calbindin, and parvalbumin are markers of separate populations of local circuit neurons in monkey prefrontal cortex, and that they may be useful tools in unraveling the intrinsic inhibitory circuitry of the primate prefrontal cortex in but normal and disease states.",

Projection neurons of lamina VIa were large and medium sized pyramidal neurons (including atypical and multiapical), small pyramidal cells, and spinous multipolar neurons with long descending axons. Projection neurons of lamina VIb were medium sized pyramidal neurons and small pyramids, horizontal pyramids, inverted pyramidal cells, spinous multipolar neurons with long descending axons and large fusiform cells. Local circuit neurons of lamina VIa were Martinotti cells, basket neurons, neurogliaform cells, sparsely spinous neurons with whirled axons, spine-free multipolar cells and bipolar neurons. Local circuit neurons of lamina VIb were sparsely spinous and spine-free multipolar cells with short axons and bipolar neurons. Marked differences were observed between gyral, intermediate and fissural regions. Fusiform and bipolar neurons were vertically arranged in the former, but were tangentially orientated in intermediate and fissural regions; inverted pyramidal cells were present in the gyrus but horizontal pyramids were the respective cells in the intermediate and fissural zones. When compared with lissencephalic species, a great horizontal fibrillary system (which is vertically arranged in gyral regions) was observed in convoluted brains. Cells of origin were fusiform neurons, bipolar cells, horizontal and inverted pyramids and pyramidal neurons (the latter by means of horizontal axonal collaterals). The great development of this cortico-cortical association system in gyrencephalic species is considered to be a major step in neocortical evolution.",

            "The sixth layer of the cerebral cortex has been studied by means of the Golgi method in Carnivora (dog and cat), Artiodactyla (cow and sheep), and Primates (human) brains; a basic structural uniformity being observed in all these species. Projection neurons of lamina VIa were large and medium sized pyramidal neurons (including atypical and multiapical), small pyramidal cells, and spinous multipolar neurons with long descending axons. Projection neurons of lamina VIb were medium sized pyramidal neurons and small pyramids, horizontal pyramids, inverted pyramidal cells, spinous multipolar neurons with long descending axons and large fusiform cells. Local circuit neurons of lamina VIa were Martinotti cells, basket neurons, neurogliaform cells, sparsely spinous neurons with whirled axons, spine-free multipolar cells and bipolar neurons. Local circuit neurons of lamina VIb were sparsely spinous and spine-free multipolar cells with short axons and bipolar neurons. Marked differences were observed between gyral, intermediate and fissural regions. Fusiform and bipolar neurons were vertically arranged in the former, but were tangentially orientated in intermediate and fissural regions; inverted pyramidal cells were present in the gyrus but horizontal pyramids were the respective cells in the intermediate and fissural zones. When compared with lissencephalic species, a great horizontal fibrillary system (which is vertically arranged in gyral regions) was observed in convoluted brains. Cells of origin were fusiform neurons, bipolar cells, horizontal and inverted pyramids and pyramidal neurons (the latter by means of horizontal axonal collaterals). The great development of this cortico-cortical association system in gyrencephalic species is considered to be a major step in neocortical evolution."

            "In the primate neocortex, little is known about the possible associations between functional subclasses of GABA neurons, their morphological properties and calcium-binding protein (CaBP) content. We used whole-cell current clamp recordings, combined with intracellular labeling and fluorescence immunohistochemistry, to determine these relationships for interneurons in layers 2-3 of monkey prefrontal cortex (PFC). Eighty-one interneurons were included in the analysis. Thirty-eight of these cells showed immunoreactivity for one of the three CaBPs tested. Co-localization of more than one CaBP was not observed in any of the interneurons examined. Interneurons with different CaBPs formed distinct populations with specific physiological membrane properties and morphological features. Parvalbumin (PV)-positive cells had the physiological properties characteristic of fast-spiking interneurons (FS) and the morphology of basket or chandelier neurons. Most calretinin (CR)-containing cells had the physiological properties ascribed to non-fast-spiking cells (non-FS) and a vertically oriented axonal morphology, similar to that of double bouquet cells. Calbindin (CB)-positive interneurons also had non-FS properties and included cells with double bouquet morphology or with a characteristic dense web of axonal collaterals in layer 1. Classification of the interneurons based on cluster analysis of multiple electrophysiological properties suggested the existence of at least two distinct groups of interneurons. The first group contained mainly PV-positive FS cells and the second group consisted predominantly of CR- and CB-positive non-FS interneurons. These findings may help to illuminate the functional roles of different groups of interneurons in primate PFC circuitry."

The areal and laminar distributions of CR, PV, and CB cells were consistent across mPFC; their morphological characteristics identified them as local circuit neurons.

Since these local circuit neurons play crucial functional roles, the aim of this study was to provide supportive quantitative data defining their areal and laminar distribution in mPFC. The numerical densities of neurons (Nv, number of cells per mm3) in each area and layer were calculated stereologically. The mean total neuronal NV estimates across mPFC was 55,727 +/- 3,319 per mm3 (mean +/- S.D.; n = 3); values ranged from 50,489 +/- 8,374 per mm3 (area 24a) to 59,938 +/- 7,214 per mm3 (area 24c). Interareal differences were not significant. Cortical depth measurements and neuronal NV estimates for each area allowed the absolute number of neurons in a column of cortex under 1 mm2 of surface to be calculated; values varied between 86,457 +/- 15,063 (area 24a) and 128,464 +/- 24,050 (area 24c). Using immunolabelled Nissl-stained sections of mPFC, CR+ neurons constituted 11.2%, PV+ neurons 5.9%, and CB+ neurons 5.0% of the total neuron population. GABA+ neurons represented an overall 24.9% (23.5-27.3%) of neurons in the mPFC. Differences between areas were not significant. The cortical depth distribution histograms of CR+, PV+, CB+, and GABA+ cell populations in each area were derived and the percentage of a given cell population in each layer subsequently calculated. Peaks in the cortical depth distributions of CR+ and CB+ neurons occurred in layer 2 and upper layer 3, respectively; the peak distribution of PV+ neurons occurred between lower layer 3 and upper layer 5. The depth distribution of GABA+ cells reflected the combined distributions of CR+, PV+ and CR+ neurons. In all areas, the majority (74.4-84.0%) of the GABA cell population was located in layers 2/3. The depth distributions for each cell type were similar between areas. Diaphorase-reactive neurons accounted for 0.25% (0.2-0.32%) of all cortical neurons in mPFC and were distributed in two horizontal strata, in midlayer 3 and in mid/upper layer 6. A large population of diaphorase-reactive cells was present in the white matter. The absolute numbers of CR+, PV+, CB+ and GABA+ neurons within individual layers in a column of cortex under 1 mm2 and 50 x 50 microns of cortical surface have been derived.

In visual areas (V1, V2, and V4), somatosensory areas (3b, 1, and 2), and motor area 4, a punctate discontinuous pattern of connections is made from 200-microns-diameter biocytin injections in the superficial layers. In prefrontal cortex (areas 9 and 46), stripe-like connectivity patterns are observed. In all areas of cortex examined, the width of the terminal-free gaps is closely scaled to the average diameter of terminal patches, or width of terminal stripes. In addition, both patch and gap dimensions match the average lateral spread of the dendritic field of single pyramidal neurons in the superficial layers of the same cortical region. These architectural features of the connectional mosaics are constant despite a twofold difference in scale across cortical areas and different species. They therefore appear to be fundamental features of cortical organization. A model is offered in which local circuit inhibitory \"basket\" interneurons, activated at the same time as excitatory pyramidal neurons, could veto pyramidal neuron connections within either circular or stripe-like domains; this could lead to the formation of the pattern of lateral connections observed in this study, and provides a framework for further theoretical studies of cerebral cortex function.",

            "We have used small injections of biocytin to label and compare patterns of intraareal, laterally spreading projections of pyramidal neurons in a number of areas of macaque monkey cerebral cortex. In visual areas (V1, V2, and V4), somatosensory areas (3b, 1, and 2), and motor area 4, a punctate discontinuous pattern of connections is made from 200-microns-diameter biocytin injections in the superficial layers. In prefrontal cortex (areas 9 and 46), stripe-like connectivity patterns are observed. In all areas of cortex examined, the width of the terminal-free gaps is closely scaled to the average diameter of terminal patches, or width of terminal stripes. In addition, both patch and gap dimensions match the average lateral spread of the dendritic field of single pyramidal neurons in the superficial layers of the same cortical region. These architectural features of the connectional mosaics are constant despite a twofold difference in scale across cortical areas and different species. They therefore appear to be fundamental features of cortical organization. A model is offered in which local circuit inhibitory \"basket\" interneurons, activated at the same time as excitatory pyramidal neurons, could veto pyramidal neuron connections within either circular or stripe-like domains; this could lead to the formation of the pattern of lateral connections observed in this study, and provides a framework for further theoretical studies of cerebral cortex function."

The calcium-binding proteins, calretinin, calbindin, and parvalbumin, are expressed in a variety of cortical local circuit neurons. However, in the primate prefrontal cortex, relatively little is known, especially with regard to calretinin, about the specific classes or distribution of local circuit neurons that contain these calcium-binding proteins. In this study, we used immunohistochemical techniques to characterize and compare the morphological features and distribution in macaque monkey prefrontal cortex of local circuit neurons that contain each of these calcium-binding proteins. On the basis of the axonal features of the labeled neurons, and correlations with previous Golgi studies, calretinin appeared to be present in double-bouquet neurons, calbindin in neurogliaform neurons and Martinotti cells, and parvalbumin in chandelier and wide arbor (basket) neurons. Calretinin was also found in other cell populations, such as a distinctive group of large neurons in the infragranular layers, but it was not possible to assign these neurons to a known cell class. In addition, although the animals studied were adults, immunoreactivity for both calretinin and calbindin was found in Cajal-Retzius neurons of layer I. Dual labeling studies confirmed that with the exception of the Cajal-Retzius neurons, each calcium-binding protein was expressed in separate populations of prefrontal cortical neurons. Comparisons of the laminar distributions of the labeled neurons also indicated that these calcium-binding proteins were segregated into discrete neuronal populations. Calretinin-positive neurons were present in greatest density in deep layer I and layer II, calbindin-immunoreactive cells were most dense in layers II-superficial III, and parvalbumin-containing neurons were present in greatest density in the middle cortical layers. In addition, the relative density of calretinin-labeled neurons was approximately twice that of the calbindin- and parvalbumin-positive neurons. However, within each group of labeled neurons, their laminar distribution and relative density did not differ substantially across regions of the prefrontal cortex. These findings demonstrate that calretinin, calbindin, and parvalbumin are markers of separate populations of local circuit neurons in monkey prefrontal cortex, and that they may be useful tools in unraveling the intrinsic inhibitory circuitry of the primate prefrontal cortex in but normal and disease states.",

We decided to estimate the total number of neocortical neurons in the normal human brain and to analyze it with respect to the major macro- and microscopical structural components, to study the internal relationships of these components, and to quantitate the influence of important physiological variables on brain structure. The 94 brains reported represent a consecutive collection of brains from the general Danish population. The average numbers of neocortical neurons were 19 billion in female brains and 23 billion in male brains, a 16% difference. In our study, which covered the age range from 20 years to 90 years, approximately 10% of all neocortical neurons are lost over the life span in both sexes. Sex and age were the main determinants of the total number of neurons in the human neocortex, whereas body size, per se, had no influence on neuron number. Some of the data presented have been analyzed by using new mathematical designs. An equation predicting the total neocortical neuron number in any individual in which sex and age are known is provided.",

Such studies have included the total neocortical number of neurons and glial cells, the estimated size distribution of neocortical neurons, the total myelinated fiber length in the brain white matter, the total number of synapses in the neocortex, and the effect of normal aging on these structural elements. The difference in total number of neurons was found to be less than 10% over the age range from 20 to 90 years, while the glial cell number in six elderly individuals, mean age 89.2 years, showed an average number of 36 billion glial cells, which was not statistically significantly different from the 39 billion glial cells in the neocortex of six young individuals with a mean age of 26.2 years. The total myelinated fiber length varied from 150,000 to 180,000 km in young individuals and showed a large reduction as a function of age. The total number of synapses in the human neocortex is approximately 0.15 x 10(15) (0.15 quadrillion). Although the effect of aging is seen in all estimated structural elements, the effect of sex is actually higher. The functional relevance of these differences in neuron numbers in both age and gender is not known.",

Still small in marsupials and insectivores, this \"new\" structure attains amazing dimensions in anthropoids and cetaceans. Neocortical neurons can be allocated to one of two basic categories: pyramidal and nonpyramidal cells. The pyramidal neurons form the principal elements in neocortical circuitry, accounting for at least 70% of the total neocortical population. The evolutionary development of the pyramidal neurons can be traced from simple, \"extraverted\" neurons in the amphibian pallium, via pyramid-like neurons in the reptilian cortex to the fully developed neocortical elements designated by Cajal as \"psychic cells\". Typical mammalian pyramidal neurons have the following eight features in common: (1) spiny dendrites, (2) a stout radially oriented apical dendrite, forming (3) a terminal bouquet in the most superficial cortical layer, (4) a set of basal dendrites, (5) an axon descending to the subcortical white matter, (6) a number of intracortical axon collaterals, (7) terminals establishing synaptic contacts of the round vesicle/asymmetric variety, and (8) the use of the excitatory aminoacids glutamate and/or aspartate as their neurotransmitter.

In grossly simplified terms and assuming random connectivity, such studies predict that input from the thalamus terminates primarily in layer 4, is relayed 'forward' to layer 3, then to layers 5 and 6 from where the modified signal may exit the cortex. Projection patterns also indicate 'back' projections from layer 5 to 3 and layer 6 to 4. More recently it has become clear that the interconnections between these layers are not random; forward projections primarily contact specific pyramidal subclasses and intracortical back projections innervate interneurones. This indicates that presynaptic axons or postsynaptic dendrites are capable of selecting their synaptic partners and that this selectivity is layer dependent. For the past decade, we and others have studied pyramidal cell targeting in circuits both within, and between laminae using paired intracellular recordings with biocytin filling and have begun to identify further levels of selectivity through the preferential targeting of electrophysiologically and/or morphologically distinct pyramidal subtypes. Presented here, therefore, is a brief overview of current thinking on the layer and subclass specific connectivity of neocortical principle excitatory cells.",

This circuitry is described here in the context of a two-level model that distinguishes between feedforward and feedback connections. Embedded within this basic framework is a more complex organization. Within the strictly feedforward pathway, these circuits distribute unique combinations of magno-, parvo-, and koniocellular input from the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) to neurons in layers 2-4B. Their input is dependent on the extrastriate cortical areas they target. The local feedback connections from deep layers (5 and 6) arise from a diverse population of pyramidal neurons. Each type forms local connections with a unique relationship to more superficial layers. In the case of layer 6 neurons, these connections are closely related to layer 4 subdivisions receiving input from different functional streams.",

The mouse cortex displays a number of other features that distinguish it from the cortex of primates and suggest a somewhat less complex pattern of organization. Nevertheless, dramatic findings on the origins and migratory patterns of newly specified GABAergic cortical interneurons in the embryonic mouse have led to a prevailing view that GABAergic cortical interneurons of all species are born in the ganglionic eminence and undergo the same long tangential migration toward the cortex that is seen in the mouse. Recent observations in fetal human and monkey brains, although clearly identifying GABAergic neurons that reach the neocortex via the tangential route, also demonstrate that substantial numbers of GABA neurons are generated in the lateral ventricular neuroepithelium and migrate into the cortex via the same radial route followed by glutamatergic neurons. In the course of evolution of the higher primate cortex, it is likely that new forms of cortical interneuron with origins in the ventricular neuroepithelium have been added to an older population derived from the ganglionic eminence.",

            "The neocortex of primates, including humans, is thought to contain significantly higher numbers and more diverse forms of gamma-aminobutyric acidergic (GABAergic) interneurons than that of rodents. The mouse cortex displays a number of other features that distinguish it from the cortex of primates and suggest a somewhat less complex pattern of organization. Nevertheless, dramatic findings on the origins and migratory patterns of newly specified GABAergic cortical interneurons in the embryonic mouse have led to a prevailing view that GABAergic cortical interneurons of all species are born in the ganglionic eminence and undergo the same long tangential migration toward the cortex that is seen in the mouse. Recent observations in fetal human and monkey brains, although clearly identifying GABAergic neurons that reach the neocortex via the tangential route, also demonstrate that substantial numbers of GABA neurons are generated in the lateral ventricular neuroepithelium and migrate into the cortex via the same radial route followed by glutamatergic neurons. In the course of evolution of the higher primate cortex, it is likely that new forms of cortical interneuron with origins in the ventricular neuroepithelium have been added to an older population derived from the ganglionic eminence."

These cells showed abrupt episodes of non-adapting repetitive discharges; (ii) late-spiking (LS) cells exhibiting slowly developing ramp depolarizations, including neurogliaform cells; (iii) the remaining groups contained both burst-spiking (BS) or regular-spiking (RS) non-pyramidal (NP) cells. BSNP cells exhibited bursting activity (two or more spikes on slow depolarizing humps) from hyperpolarized potentials. Both these physiological types corresponded to a range of morphologies: (i) somatostatin-containing Martinotti cells with ascending axonal arbors to layer I (some were also positive for calbindin D28k); (ii) VIP-containing double bouquet cells with descending axonal arbors as well as arcade cells (these included small cells immunoreactive for CCK or calretinin).

We have divided GABA cells in the rat frontal cortex into 3 groups, based on their firing characteristics: fast-spiking (FS) cells, late-spiking (LS) cells, and non-FS cells. Expression of calcium-binding proteins and peptides could be shown in separate groups of GABA cells in layers II/III and V of the frontal cortex: (1) parvalbumin cells, (2) somatostatin cells, (3) calretinin and/or vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP) cells [partially positive for cholecystokinin (CCK)] and (4) large CCK cells (almost negative for VIP/calretinin). Combining the physiological and chemical properties of morphologically diverse nonpyramidal cells allows division into several groups, including FS basket cells containing parvalbumin, non-FS somatostatin Martinotti cells with ascending axonal arbors, and non-FS large basket cells positive for CCK. These subtypes show characteristic spatial distributions of axon collaterals and the innervation tendency of postsynaptic elements. With synchronized activity induced by cortical excitatory or inhibitory circuits, firing patterns were also found to differ. Subtype-selective occurrence of electrical coupling, finding for potassium channel Kv3.1 proteins, and cholinergic and serotonergic modulation supports our tentative classification. To clarify the functional architecture in the frontal cortex, it is important to reveal the connectional characteristics of GABA cell subtypes and determine whether they are similar to those in other cortical regions.",

            "Mammals adapt to a rapidly changing world because of the sophisticated cognitive functions that are supported by the neocortex. The neocortex, which forms almost 80% of the human brain, seems to have arisen from repeated duplication of a stereotypical microcircuit template with subtle specializations for different brain regions and species. The quest to unravel the blueprint of this template started more than a century ago and has revealed an immensely intricate design. The largest obstacle is the daunting variety of inhibitory interneurons that are found in the circuit. This review focuses on the organizing principles that govern the diversity of inhibitory interneurons and their circuits."

The classification of interneurons in the primate neocortex is further complicated by a less extensive database of the features of these neurons and by reported interspecies differences. Consequently, in this study we characterized 8 different morphological types of interneurons from monkey prefrontal cortex, 4 of which have not been previously classified. These interneuron types differed in their expression of molecular markers and clustered into 3 different electrophysiological classes. The first class consisted of fast-spiking parvalbumin-positive chandelier and linear arbor cells. The second class comprised 5 different morphological types of continuous-adapting calretinin- or calbindin-positive interneurons that had the lowest level of firing threshold. However, 2 of these morphological types had short spike duration, which is not typical for rodent adapting cells. Neurogliaform cells (NGFCs), which coexpressed calbindin and neuropeptide Y, formed the third class, characterized by strong initial adaptation. They did not exhibit the delayed spikes seen in rodent NGFCs. These results indicate that primate interneurons have some specific properties; consequently, direct translation of classification schemes developed from studies in rodents to primates might be inappropriate.",
