            "Paired intracellular recordings with biocytin labelling were made in slices of adult rat somatosensory and visual cortex and in cat visual cortex to examine the properties of synaptic connections made by layer 6 pyramidal cells, to determine whether cortico-cortical pyramids more commonly provide input to other layer 6 pyramids than cortico-thalamic cells, and whether these connections exhibit paired pulse and brief train depression. Pyramidal cells with cortico-cortical like morphology were 2-4 times more likely to innervate other pyramidal cells than were cortico-thalamic like cells, but less likely to innervate inhibitory interneurons. The excitatory postsynaptic potentials elicited by presynaptic, phasically firing cortico-cortical pyramids in all classes of postsynaptic infragranular layer pyramidal cells exhibited strong, presynaptically mediated paired pulse and brief train depression. Those with larger paired pulse ratios also exhibited post-tetanic potentiation, but this was accompanied by stronger paired pulse and brief train depression. Both the firing characteristics and the outputs of cortico-cortical pyramidal cells display pronounced phasic characteristics, indicating that these cells respond most effectively to and preferentially pass on information related to novelty."

        ], 
        "abstract": [
            "Basal ganglia lesions have a high prevalence for associated behavioural impairments. However, the exact pattern of cognitive impairments and its relationship to individual basal ganglia lesion have rarely been investigated by means of a detailed neuropsychological and lesion study. Furthermore, different mechanisms have been proposed as relevant for the observed cognitive deficits; among these, the hypothesis of fronto-subcortical loops (Alexander et al., 1986) has made predictions regarding the relationship between the damage of particular striato-frontal circuits and the resulting behavioural impairment which await clinical confirmation. We present a study of two subjects who suffered a MRI-documented focal left basal ganglia hematoma. The two patients differed in their lesions; in one patient (PJ) large parts of the caudate nucleus were destroyed whereas in the other (AS) mainly the pallidum and putamen were lesioned and the caudate suffered only minor damage. In the acute phase, the behavioural and neuropsychological abnormalities were similar in both cases and included mainly abulia, an impairment of executive and attentional functions, and a severe amnestic syndrome. After several months many functions were restored in AS, whereas PJ's abilities remained largely defective. Based on these data and on previous case studies several conclusions are drawn. Left caudate lesions induce marked and long-lasting behavioural and neuropsychological impairments comprising predominantly drive, executive control, attention, and memory. The extent of lesion in the head of the caudate nucleus is the critical factor regarding the severity and the outcome of the syndrome, whereas damage to the putamen and pallidum is less crucial for cognitive functions. A subset of behavioural alterations, among them abulia, attentional and frontal-executive dysfunctions, can well be attributed to lesions of the anterior cingulate circuit and the dorsolateral-frontal circuit at the basal ganglia level. Other impairments, most importantly the prominent amnestic syndrome, are more difficult to interpret on the grounds of this hypothesis and may be related to other pathomechanisms."

        "abstract": [
            "THALAMUS: The human thalamus is a nuclear complex located in the diencephalon and comprising of four parts (the hypothalamus, the epythalamus, the ventral thalamus, and the dorsal thalamus). The thalamus is a relay centre subserving both sensory and motor mechanisms. Thalamic nuclei (50-60 nuclei) project to one or a few well-defined cortical areas. Multiple cortical areas receive afferents from a single thalamic nucleus and send back information to different thalamic nuclei. The corticofugal projection provides positive feedback to the \"correct\" input, while at the same time suppressing irrelevant information. Topographical organisation of the thalamic afferents and efferents is contralateral, and the lateralisation of the thalamic functions affects both sensory and motoric aspects. Symptoms of lesions located in the thalamus are closely related to the function of the areas involved. An infarction or haemorrhage thalamic lesion can develop somatosensory disturbances and/or central pain in the opposite hemibody, analgesic or purely algesic thalamic syndrome characterised by contralateral anaesthesia (or hypaesthesia), contralateral weakness, ataxia and, often, persistent spontaneous pain. BASAL GANGLIA: Basal ganglia form a major centre in the complex extrapyramidal motor system, as opposed to the pyramidal motor system (corticobulbar and corticospinal pathways). Basal ganglia are involved in many neuronal pathways having emotional, motivational, associative and cognitive functions as well. The striatum (caudate nucleus, putamen and nucleus accumbens) receive inputs from all cortical areas and, throughout the thalamus, project principally to frontal lobe areas (prefrontal, premotor and supplementary motor areas) which are concerned with motor planning. These circuits: (i) have an important regulatory influence on cortex, providing information for both automatic and voluntary motor responses to the pyramidal system; (ii) play a role in predicting future events, reinforcing wanted behaviour and suppressing unwanted behaviour, and (iii) are involved in shifting attentional sets and in both high-order processes of movement initiation and spatial working memory. Basal ganglia-thalamo-cortical circuits maintain somatotopic organisation of movement-related neurons throughout the circuit. These circuits reveal functional subdivisions of the oculomotor, prefrontal and cingulate circuits, which play an important role in attention, learning and potentiating behaviour-guiding rules. Involvement of the basal ganglia is related to involuntary and stereotyped movements or paucity of movements without involvement of voluntary motor functions, as in Parkinson's disease, Wilson's disease, progressive supranuclear palsy or Huntington's disease. The symptoms differ with the location of the lesion. The commonest disturbances in basal ganglia lesions are abulia (apathy with loss of initiative and of spontaneous thought and emotional responses) and dystonia, which become manifest as behavioural and motor disturbances, respectively."

            "Neural assemblies are assumed to become organized and to operate within the cerebral cortex, and so must be constrained by the cytological and physiological properties of this laminated structure. A hypothesis of such assemblies is presented, based on important details of neuronal architecture and physiology in different cortical laminae. Laminae II, III and VI, which are the origin and termination of most cortico-cortical projections, are regarded as the site of storage of most of the information encoded by assemblies - a neuronal 'library'. Laminae II and III are the most sensitive coincidence detectors, and therefore probably initiate the process of assembly formation. However, these three laminae have very low levels of spontaneous activity in the waking state, and so active cell assemblies cannot base their functioning on these laminae alone. Lamina V pyramidal cells have a much higher level of spontaneous activity. Thus, indirect pathways between 'library' cells, via lamina V pyramidal cells, are likely to be more secure than direct ones. It is proposed that direct links between 'library' cells become stabilized by Hebbian strengthening, once the recipient 'library' cell has been 'primed' by neural activity transmitted indirectly via lamina V neurones. Thus lamina V neurones could catalyse the process of assembly formation. Given this proposal, lamina V cells, in their interaction with 'library' cells, would code information in terms of precisely timed individual impulses, but would employ a code based on slower frequency changes in their descending influences upon neural centres in the brainstem and spinal cord. Predictions for single unit and electrographic experiments are discussed."

            "Layer 5 neurons in primary visual cortex make putative reciprocal feedback connections to the superficial layers. To test this hypothesis, we employed scanning laser photostimulation combined with intracellular dye injection to examine local functional excitatory inputs to and axonal projections from individual layer 5 neurons in brain slices from monkey V1. In contrast with previous studies of other V1 neurons, layer 5 neurons received significant input from nearly all of the cortical layers, suggesting individual layer 5 cells integrate information from a broad range of input sources. Nevertheless relative strengths of laminar inputs varied across neurons. Cluster analysis of relative strength of laminar inputs to individual layer 5 neurons revealed four discrete clusters representing recurring input patterns; each cluster included both excitatory and inhibitory neurons. Twenty-five of 40 layer 5 neurons fell into two clusters, both characterized by very strong input from superficial layers. These input patterns are consistent with layer 5 neurons providing feedback to superficial layers. The remaining 15 neurons received stronger input from deep layers. Differences in input from layer 4Calpha versus 4Cbeta also suggest specific associations of the magnocellular and parvocellular visual pathways, with populations receiving stronger input from deep versus superficial cortical layers."

In this review, we summarize recent findings where molecular biological techniques have revealed a small number of area-specific genes in the nonhuman primate cortex. One of these (occ1) is strongly expressed in primary visual cortex and is associated with thalamocortical connections. Another gene, RBP, is more strongly expressed in association areas. It is not clear whether RBP might be linked with any particular connectional system, but several possibilities are raised. We also discuss possible roles of area-specific genes in postnatal development, and conclude with a brief sketch of future directions."

            "The fine morphology of hippocampal connections to the orbital and medial frontal cortex (OMFC) was investigated by placing injections of anterograde tracers in the CA1 in two monkeys. The axons terminated mainly in layers 2 and 3, of areas 11, 13, 14c, 25, and 32, and were widely divergent in these layers, traversing 2-4 mm. Boutons were scattered along the main axon, but also occurred as distinctive small, spherical clusters of terminations (\"mini-clusters\"; diameter <50 mum). Occasional larger terminal arbors were observed in layer 3 and these were often unusually tortuous or convoluted. These features may imply a specialized microcircuitry of hippocampal-OMFC connections, including an origin from a particular subpopulation of CA1 projection neurons."

            "Nonreciprocal feedback connections from ventromedial areas TE and TF have previously been reported to visual areas V1 and V2 (Kennedy and Bullier, 1985; Rockland and Van Hoesen, 1994). The present report confirms these earlier observations by utilizing anterograde label in conjunction with serial section analysis. Furthermore, it directly demonstrates the divergent configuration and range of these terminal fields. Thirteen axons were analyzed from ventromedial TE (4) or area TF (9) to occipitotemporal areas, and two from area TF to the upper bank of the intraparietal sulcus (IPS). All these axons have narrow, elongated fields that range from 4.0-21.0 mm. Terminations are distributed linearly along the axon or, in some cases, concentrated in irregularly spaced clusters. Most of these axons have terminations concentrated in layer 1. The two axons in the IPS have a bistratified terminal distribution (in layers 1-3 and 6) in their anterior field, but a distinctly different laminar pattern (with terminations concentrated in layer 1) in their distal 2.0 mm. These fields probably correspond to different areas, most likely MIP and PO. Axons projecting from higher order to early visual areas may contribute to extraperceptual, complex processes within area V1, such as activation in response to visual imagery, and are a possible substrate for synchronous linkage of spatially discrete assemblies of neurons. In summary, these results demonstrate 1) that some neurons in ventromedial TE and TF are in direct communication with early visual areas, including V1 and V2, and 2) that some feedback axons target several areas, sometimes with different laminar termination patterns. These results emphasize that cortical areas are interrelated by multiple direct and indirect pathways, not all of which are strictly hierarchical."

        "abstract": [
            "The function of the cerebral cortex is dependent on the precise organization of the circuits formed by its component neurons. The connections between neurons are not random, but are specific at multiple levels of organization. For example, each cortical area connects to only a selected subset of other areas and within any given area the axonal and dendritic arbors of individual neurons arborize in precise, layer-specific patterns (for review see Felleman & Van Essen, 1991; Callaway, 1998). In each layer there are dendrites from multiple cell types including cells with somata both within and outside that layer. Anatomical studies have shown that axons arborizing in a particular cortical layer can connect selectively onto dendrites of some cell types in the layer, while avoiding the dendrites of other cell types (e.g. Freund & Gulyas, 1991; Hornung & Celio, 1992; Staiger et al., 1996). These cell type specific connections are, however, difficult to elucidate with anatomical methods, so the frequency of such specificity has remained elusive. Recent experimental methods combining intracellular recording of single neurons with focal neuronal stimulation by uncaging glutamate with light (\"photostimulation\") have made the analysis of cell type specific cortical connections more tractable. These studies show that cell type specificity of connections is prevalent in cortex. Here I review photostimulation-based studies investigating the laminar sources of cortical input to distinct cell types in the visual and somatosensory cortices of rats and the primary visual cortex of monkeys."

        "abstract": [
            "Layer 6 of monkey V1 contains a physiologically and anatomically diverse population of excitatory pyramidal neurons. Distinctive arborization patterns of axons and dendrites within the functionally specialized cortical layers define eight types of layer 6 pyramidal neurons and suggest unique information processing roles for each cell type. To address how input sources contribute to cellular function, we examined the laminar sources of functional excitatory input onto individual layer 6 pyramidal neurons using scanning laser photostimulation. We find that excitatory input sources correlate with cell type. Class I neurons with axonal arbors selectively targeting magnocellular (M) recipient layer 4Calpha receive input from M-dominated layer 4B, whereas class I neurons whose axonal arbors target parvocellular (P) recipient layer 4Cbeta receive input from P-dominated layer 2/3. Surprisingly, these neuronal types do not differ significantly in the inputs they receive directly from layers 4Calpha or 4Cbeta. Class II cells, which lack dense axonal arbors within layer 4C, receive excitatory input from layers targeted by their local axons. Specifically, type IIA cells project axons to and receive input from the deep but not superficial layers. Type IIB neurons project to and receive input from the deepest and most superficial, but not middle layers. Type IIC neurons arborize throughout the cortical layers and tend to receive inputs from all cortical layers. These observations have implications for the functional roles of different layer 6 cell types in visual information processing."

Our approach is novel in three important respects. First, our method assumes and exploits detailed knowledge of the signals we wish to attend to in the cocktail party environment. Second, our goal is to provide preprocessing in advance of a pattern recognition system rather than to separate one or more of the mixed sources explicitly. Third, the neural network model we employ is more biologically feasible than are most other approaches to the cocktail party problem. Although the focus here is on the cocktail party problem, the method presented in this study can be applied to other areas of information processing."

            "At synapses throughout the brain and spinal cord, the amino-acid glutamate is the major excitatory neurotransmitter. During evolution, a family of glutamate-receptor ion channels seems to have been assembled from a kit consisting of discrete ligand-binding, ion-channel, modulatory and cytoplasmic domains. Crystallographic studies that exploit this unique architecture have greatly aided structural analysis of the ligand-binding core, but the results also pose a formidable challenge, namely that of resolving the allosteric mechanisms by which individual domains communicate and function in an intact receptor."

        "abstract": [
            "Spike timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) is a learning rule that modifies the strength of a neuron's synapses as a function of the precise temporal relations between input and output spikes. In many brains areas, temporal aspects of spike trains have been found to be highly reproducible. How will STDP affect a neuron's behavior when it is repeatedly presented with the same input spike pattern? We show in this theoretical study that repeated inputs systematically lead to a shaping of the neuron's selectivity, emphasizing its very first input spikes, while steadily decreasing the postsynaptic response latency. This was obtained under various conditions of background noise, and even under conditions where spiking latencies and firing rates, or synchrony, provided conflicting informations. The key role of first spikes demonstrated here provides further support for models using a single wave of spikes to implement rapid neural processing."

        "abstract": [
            "Past theories about the circuitry that promotes integration of the whole cerebral cortex and thalamus during forebrain activities that underlie different states of consciousness have relied on the intralaminar nuclei as the sources of diffuse thalamocortical projections that could facilitate spread of activity across many cortical areas. Evidence is presented to show the presence of a matrix of superficially projecting cells extending throughout the whole thalamus that could form a substrate for diffusion of activity across the cortex. The superficially projecting cells in monkeys are distinguished by immunoreactivity for the calcium-binding protein calbindin. They are found in all thalamic nuclei and are increased in some nuclei. They not only project to superficial layers of the cortex but do so over wide areas, unconstrained by boundaries between areas. They are innervated by subcortical inputs that lack the topographic order and physiological precision of the principal sensory pathways. Superimposed on the matrix, but only in certain nuclei, is a core of cells characterized by immunoreactivity for another calcium-binding protein, parvalbumin. These project to middle layers of the cortex in an area-specific and topographically ordered manner. They are innervated by subcortical inputs that are typically precise in having a high degree of topographic order and readily identifiable physiological properties. The parvalbumin cells provide the sensory and other inputs to the cortex that are to be used as a basis for perception. The diffusely projecting calbindin cells can form a basis for the engagement of multiple cortical areas and thalamic nuclei, especially when recruited by corticothalamic connections. Diffusion of activity across multiple areas and thalamic nuclei is essential for the binding of all aspects of sensory experience into a single framework of consciousness."

            "The pathways ascending through the brain stem to the medial geniculate complex of the thalamus can be distinguished by immunostaining for the calcium binding proteins parvalbumin and calbindin and by the properties of the neurons in the subdivisions of the medial geniculate complex in which they terminate. The parvalbumin pathway, ascending from the central nucleus of the inferior colliculus, is the more direct and terminates in the ventral nucleus. The calbindin pathway is more diffuse in its origins and terminates in the dorsal and medial nuclei. Ventral nucleus neurons are sharply tuned, tonotopically organized and consistent in their responses. They project to core areas of the auditory cortex characterized by high parvalbumin immunoreactivity and by similar neuronal properties. Neurons in the dorsal and medial nuclei are not frequency specific or tonotopic and are labile in their responses. They project more diffusely to belt areas of the auditory cortex in which parvalbumin immunoreactivity is reduced and in which neuronal responses are less specific than in the core. The belt areas are the origins of streams of corticocortical connections leading into the temporal, parietal, and frontal lobes. These routes can be differentially engaged in functional imaging studies of monkeys responding to biologically significant sounds."

In both humans and macaque monkeys, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) reveals a system of cortical regions that show increased blood flow when the subject views images of faces, compared with images of objects. However, the stimulus selectivity of single neurons within these fMRI-identified regions has not been studied. We used fMRI to identify and target the largest face-selective region in two macaques for single-unit recording. Almost all (97%) of the visually responsive neurons in this region were strongly face selective, indicating that a dedicated cortical area exists to support face processing in the macaque."

            "Using a transparent motion paradigm, [Valdes-Sosa, M., Bobes, M. A., Rodriguez, V., & Pinilla, T. (1998). Switching attention without shifting the spotlight object-based attentional modulation of brain potentials, Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience, 10, 137-151; Valdes-Sosa, M., Cobo, A., & Pinilla, T. (2000). Attention to object files defined by transparent motion, Journal of Experimental Psychological: Human Perception and Performance, 26, 488-505] found that when attention is endogenously directed to one surface, observers can more reliably report the direction of a brief translation of the cued than the uncued surface. Using a similar design [Reynolds, J. H., Alborzian, S., & Stoner, G. R. (2003). Exogenously cued attention triggers competitive selection of surfaces, Vision Research, 43, 59-66] found that even in the absence of an endogenous cue, the first translation acted as a potent exogenous cue that impaired the observer's ability to discriminate a subsequent translation of the other surface. We investigated the neural basis of this exogenous cueing effect by recording visual event-related potentials (ERPs) elicited by translations of the cued and uncued surfaces. Subjects were given the task of judging whether or not the first and second translations were identical in direction, and their performance was impaired when the second translation occurred on the uncued, as compared to the cued surface. The posterior C1 (75-110 ms) and N1 (160-210 ms) components of the ERP elicited by the second translation of the cued surface were larger than those elicited by translation of the uncued surface. These behavioral and ERP cueing effects were present even when the two surfaces were identical in color and thus could not be attributed to attention-related modulations of the gain of color channels. These findings provide evidence that exogenous cueing results in preferential selection of the cued surface at both early and intermediate stages of visual-cortical processing."

This stimulus lies on the boundary between two perceptual categories that correspond to clockwise and counter-clockwise rotation of a three-dimensional figure. It consists of a two-dimensional pattern of moving dots that are capable of generating these two, distinct, three-dimensional percepts. We have studied the responses of neurons in cortical area V5/MT whilst macaque monkeys report judgements about the perceptual configuration of this stimulus. We extract a quantitative statistic called 'choice probability' that expresses the covariation of neuronal activity and perceptual choice. An analysis of choice probabilities shows that the pool of neurons involved in the perceptual decisions is a tightly constrained subset of the population of sensory neurons relevant to the perceptual task."

        "abstract": [
            "The role of the primate middle temporal area (MT) in depth perception was examined by considering the trial-to-trial correlations between neuronal activity and reported depth sensations. A set of moving random dots portrayed a cylinder rotating about its principal axis. In this structure-from-motion stimulus, the direction of rotation is ambiguous and the resulting percept undergoes spontaneous fluctuations. The stimulus can be rendered unambiguous by the addition of binocular disparities. We trained monkeys to report the direction of rotation in a set of these stimuli, one of which had zero disparity. Many disparity-selective neurons in area MT are selective for the direction of rotation defined by disparity. Across repeated presentations of the ambiguous (zero-disparity) stimulus, there was a correlation between neuronal firing and the reported direction of rotation, as found by Bradley et al. (1998). Quantification of this effect using choice probabilities (Britten et al., 1996) allowed us to demonstrate that the correlation cannot be explained by eye movements, behavioral biases, or attention to spatial location. MT neurons therefore appear to be involved in the perceptual decision process. The mean choice probability (0.67) was substantially larger than that reported for MT neurons in a direction discrimination task (Britten et al., 1996). This implies that MT neurons make a different contribution to the two tasks. For the depth task, either the pool of neurons used is smaller or the correlation between neurons in the pool is larger."

Hence, improved methods for early diagnosis and noninvasive surrogates of disease severity in AD have become more imperative. Various quantitative magnetic resonance (MR) techniques that measure the anatomic, biochemical, microstructural, functional, and blood-flow changes are being evaluated as possible surrogate measures of disease progression. Cross-sectional and longitudinal studies indicate that MR-based volume measurements are potential surrogates of disease progression in AD, starting from the preclinical stages. The validity of MR-based volumetry as a surrogate marker for therapeutic efficacy in AD remains to be tested in a positive disease-modifying drug trial. Recent development of amyloid imaging tracers for positron emission tomography has been a major breakthrough in the field of imaging markers for AD. Efforts to image plaques are also underway in MR imaging. As with indirect MR measures, these approaches of directly imaging the pathological substrate will need to undergo a validation process with longitudinal studies to prove their usefulness as surrogate markers in AD."

        "abstract": [
            "Although the existence of thalamostriatal projections has long been known, the role(s) of this system in the basal ganglia circuitry remains poorly characterized. The intralaminar and ventral motor nuclei are the main sources of thalamic inputs to the striatum. This review emphasizes the high degree of anatomical and functional specificity of basal ganglia-thalamostriatal projections and discusses various aspects of the synaptic connectivity and neurochemical features that differentiate this glutamate system from the corticostriatal network. It also discusses the importance of thalamostriatal projections from the caudal intralaminar nuclei in the process of attentional orientation. A major task of future studies is to characterize the role(s) of corticostriatal and thalamostriatal pathways in regulating basal ganglia activity in normal and pathological conditions."

        "abstract": [
            "In this report, we present evidence of a small-scale modularity (<100 microm) at the border of layers 1 and 2 in neocortical areas. The modularity is best seen in tangential sections, with double-labeling immunohistochemistry to reveal overlapping or complementary relationships of different markers. The pattern is overall like a reticulum or mosaic but is described as a \"honeycomb,\" in which the walls and hollows are composed of distinct afferent and dendritic systems. We demonstrate the main components of the honeycomb in rat visual cortex. These are as follows: (1) zinc-enriched, corticocortical terminations in the walls, and in the hollows, thalamocortical terminations (labeled by antibody against vesicular glutamate transporter 2 and by cytochrome oxidase); (2) parvalbumin-dense neuropil in the walls that partly colocalizes with elevated levels of glutamate receptors 2/3, NMDAR receptor 1, and calbindin; and (3) dendritic subpopulations preferentially situated within the walls (dendrites of layer 2 neurons) or hollows (dendrites of deeper neurons in layers 3 and 5). Because the micromodularity is restricted to layers 2 and 1b, without extending into layer 3, this may be another indication of a laminar-specific substructure at different spatial scales within cortical columns. The suggestion is that corticocortical and thalamocortical terminations constitute parallel circuits at the level of layer 2, where they are segregated in association with distinct dendritic systems. Results from parvalbumin staining show that the honeycomb mosaic is not limited to rat visual cortex but can be recognized at the layer 1-2 border in other areas and species."

How do distinct neural subcircuits, composed of different classes of neuron, contribute to brain function? Approaching this question requires methods that can target specific neurons types. This can be achieved by harnessing the same machinery that builds sophistication into the brain and using it to make novel tools for investigating and manipulating the brain: molecular and genetic technology. These tools can be used to target gene expression to specific neuron types within complicated neuronal circuits, and the transgenes that are expressed can be used to elucidate and manipulate these circuits with unprecedented precision and control. These methods are likely to become the archetype for future studies linking perception, cognition and behavior to specific components of the brain."

            "'Winner-take-all' networks are an important theoretical construct in visual neuroscience. An implication of winner-take-all networks is that a stimulus that wins the competition for selection receives maximal activation and will be consciously perceived, even when selection was incorrect. In this study, competition was induced between physically presented ('real') and self-constructed ('illusory') words. Semantic activation was probed by recording event-related potential responses to a downstream target word. The results showed that only words reported by participants triggered a spread of activation in the semantic system, whereas non-reported words failed to prime the target. Both effects were independent of whether the potential primes were 'real' or 'illusory'. Our findings indicate that neural 'winner-take-all' networks extend to the processing of lexical units."

        ], 
        "abstract": [
            "The role of interneurons in neurovascular coupling was investigated by patch-clamp recordings in acute rat cortical slices, followed by single-cell reverse transcriptase-multiplex PCR (RT-mPCR) and confocal observation of biocytin-filled neurons, laminin-stained microvessels, and immunodetection of their afferents by vasoactive subcortical cholinergic (ACh) and serotonergic (5-HT) pathways. The evoked firing of single interneurons in whole-cell recordings was sufficient to either dilate or constrict neighboring microvessels. Identification of vasomotor interneurons by single-cell RT-mPCR revealed expression of vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) or nitric oxide synthase (NOS) in interneurons inducing dilatation and somatostatin (SOM) in those eliciting contraction. Constrictions appeared spatially restricted, maximal at the level of neurite apposition, and were associated with contraction of surrounding smooth muscle cells, providing the first evidence for neural regulation of vascular sphincters. Direct perfusion of VIP and NO donor onto the slices dilated microvessels, whereas neuropeptide Y (NPY) and SOM induced vasoconstriction. RT-PCR analyses revealed expression of specific subtypes of neuropeptide receptors in smooth muscle cells from intracortical microvessels, compatible with the vasomotor responses they elicited. By triple and quadruple immunofluorescence, the identified vasomotor interneurons established contacts with local microvessels and received, albeit to a different extent depending on interneuron subtypes, somatic and dendritic afferents from ACh and 5-HT pathways. Our results demonstrate the ability of specific subsets of cortical GABA interneurons to transmute neuronal signals into vascular responses and further suggest that they could act as local integrators of neurovascular coupling for subcortical vasoactive pathways."

            "Our understanding of the organization of the basal ganglia has advanced markedly over the last 10 years, mainly due to increased knowledge of their anatomical, neurochemical and physiological organization. These developments have led to a unifying model of the functional organization of the basal ganglia in both health and disease. The hypothesis is based on the so-called \"direct\" and \"indirect\" pathways of the flow of cortical information through the basal ganglia and has profoundly influenced the field of basal ganglia research, providing a framework for anatomical, physiological and clinical studies. The recent introduction of powerful techniques for the analysis of neuronal networks has led to further developments in our understanding of the basal ganglia. The objective of this commentary is to build upon the established model of the basal ganglia connectivity and review new anatomical findings that lead to the refinement of some aspects of the model. Four issues will be discussed. (1) The existence of several routes for the flow of cortical information along \"indirect\" pathways. (2) The synaptic convergence of information flowing through the \"direct\" and \"indirect\" pathways at the single-cell level in the basal ganglia output structures. (3) The convergence of functionally diverse information from the globus pallidus and the ventral pallidum at different levels of the basal ganglia. (4) The interconnections between the two divisions of the pallidal complex and the subthalamic nucleus and the characterization of the neuronal network underlying the indirect pathways. The findings summarized in this commentary confirm and elaborate the models of the direct and indirect pathways of information flow through the basal ganglia and provide a morphological framework for future studies."

        "abstract": [
            "Small injections of biocytin in the external segment of the pallidum (GPe) of the squirrel monkey (Saimiri sciureus) led to anterograde labeling of fibers in the thalamic reticular nucleus (NRT). These fibers reached NRT by coursing along the ventral tip of the internal capsule or by directly piercing the internal capsule more dorsally. They arborized profusely within the entire rostrocaudal extent of the nucleus. Within NRT, biocytin-labeled fibers were long, slightly varicosed, and emitted numerous short collaterals whose terminal portions consisted of clusters of large varicosities. Some of these varicosities were closely apposed to cell bodies and proximal dendrites of NRT neurons. Small injections of wheat germ-agglutinated horseradish peroxidase in the rostral pole of NRT led to retrograde cell labeling within the entire rostrocaudal extent of GPe. These retrogradely-labeled cells did not display immunoreactivity for choline acetyltransferase. Hence, beside the well-established projection from the internal pallidum to the thalamus, our findings support the existence of another pallidothalamic projection whereby GPe neurons could exert a powerful influence upon the thalamocortical neurons via a relay in NRT."

        "abstract": [
            "The advance of knowledge of the thalamic reticular nucleus and its connections has been reviewed and Max Cowan's contributions to this knowledge and to the methods used for studying the nucleus have been summarized. Whereas 50 years ago the nucleus was seen as a diffusely organized cell group closely related to the brain stem reticular formation, it can now be seen as a complex, tightly organized entity that has a significant inhibitory, modulatory action on the thalamic relay to cortex. The nucleus is under the control, on the one hand, of topographically organized afferents from the cerebral cortex and the thalamus, and on the other of more diffuse afferents from brain stem, basal forebrain, and other regions. Whereas the second group of afferents can be expected to have global actions on thalamocortical transmission, relevant for overall attentive state, the former group will have local actions, modulating transmission through the thalamus to cortex with highly specific local effects. Since it appears that all areas of cortex and all parts of the thalamus are linked directly to the reticular nucleus, it now becomes important to define how the several pathways that pass through the thalamus relate to each other in their reticular connections."

            "The ultrastructure of synaptic terminals from the external segment of the globus pallidus and of other synaptic terminals positive for gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) was examined in the thalamic reticular nucleus (TRN) of squirrel monkeys. Two GABA-positive terminals types were commonly encountered within the TRN neuropil. The most common type of GABAergic terminals (F terminals) are filled with dispersed pleomorphic synaptic vesicles and clusters of mitochondria. These terminals establish multiple symmetric synapses upon the somata and dendrites of TRN neurons. The external pallidal terminals, labeled with WGA-HRP, arise from thinly myelinated axons and correspond to the medium to large F terminals. A less prevalent population of smaller GABAergic synaptic profiles was also identified. The synaptic profiles in this second group contain considerably fewer pleomorphic synaptic vesicles in small irregular clusters and fewer mitochondria, establish symmetric synapses, are postsynaptic to other axonal terminals, are presynaptic to dendrites and soma, and are unlabeled following pallidal injections of WGA-HRP."

            "Physiological and morphological properties of nonpyramidal cells in layer II/III of frontal cortex of young rats were studied in vitro by whole-cell recording and intracellular staining with biocytin. Layer II/III nonpyramidal cells could be divided into four subgroups by their firing patterns in response to depolarizing current pulses and their patterns of dendritic and axonal arborizations. (1) Fast-spiking (FS) cells (35% of the total sample) showed an abrupt episode of nonadapting repetitive discharges of shorter-duration action potentials. FS cells had local and horizontal axonal arbors which did not enter layer I. This type of FS cell was immunoreactive for parvalbumin and included some basket cells. Three chandelier cells were identified as FS cells, although one chandelier cell was not identified as an FS cell. (2) Late-spiking (LS) cells (11%) exhibited slowly developing ramp depolarizations near threshold. LS cells were neurogliaform cells. (3) Low-threshold spike (LTS) cells (5%) had prominent low-threshold spikes when stimulated from hyperpolarizations. The main axons of LTS cells ascended, and the collaterals entered into layer I. (4) The remaining cells [regular-spiking nonpyramidal (RSNP) cells] (49%) could not be categorized into the above three subgroups. In some RSNP cells depolarizing pulses from hyperpolarizations induced fast depolarizing notches with small amplitude. RSNP cells had vertically elongated axonal fields, extending from layer I to V, sometimes to layer VI. This subgroup included double bouquet cells and bipolar cells. Each subgroup with a different firing mode may differentially contribute to neocortical laminar and columnar circuitry."

        "abstract": [
            "The properties of the connections made by the axons of pyramidal cells with cortico-thalamic (CT)-like morphology with a range of postsynaptic layer 6 targets were studied with dual intracellular recordings in slices of adult rat and cat neocortex. The cells were filled with biocytin and identified morphologically and, where appropriate, immunofluorescently. CT-like pyramids contacted interneurons with a very high probability (up to 1:2) but contacted other layer 6 pyramidal cells only rarely (approximately 1:80). The excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs) that they elicited both in pyramidal cells and in a variety of types of interneurons (including those immunopositive for parvalbumin and for somatostatin) facilitated, the second EPSP being larger than the first over a range of interspike intervals. Facilitation was not, however, maximal at the shortest intervals; in fact, depression was apparent at some connections at short interspike intervals. Facilitation in the majority of connections peaked at intervals of 25-35 ms and then declined slowly. Nor did these connections display the augmentation typical of many other strongly facilitating connections. Third EPSPs were smaller on average than second EPSPs, and fourth and subsequent EPSPs could be depressed (relative to first EPSPs). The properties of the outputs of these CT-like pyramidal cells are therefore quite distinct from those of other pyramidal cells, both within layer 6 and in other layers, possibly reflecting their unique role as both first order thalamo-cortical recipient and cortico-thalamic output neurons."

            "The functional role of an individual neuron within a cortical circuit is largely determined by that neuron's synaptic input. We examined the laminar sources of local input to subtypes of cortical neurons in layer 2/3 of rat visual cortex using laser scanning photostimulation. We identified three distinct laminar patterns of excitatory input that correspond to physiological and morphological subtypes of neurons. Fast-spiking inhibitory basket cells and excitatory pyramidal neurons received strong excitatory input from middle cortical layers. In contrast, adapting inhibitory interneurons received their strongest excitatory input either from deep layers or laterally from within layer 2/3. Thus, differential laminar sources of excitatory inputs contribute to the functional diversity of cortical inhibitory interneurons."

        ], 
        "abstract": [
            "The primate visual system is composed of multiple, functionally specialized cortical areas. The functional diversity among areas is thought to reflect different contributions from early parallel visual pathways to the area V1 neurons providing input to \"higher\" cortical areas. The M pathway is believed to provide information about motion and contrast, via layer 4B of V1, to dorsal visual areas. The P pathway is believed to provide information about shape and color, via layer 2/3 of V1, to ventral visual areas, with specialized contributions from cytochrome-oxidase (CO) blob versus interblob neurons. However, the detailed anatomical relationships between the M and P pathways and the neurons in V1 that provide input to higher extrastriate cortical areas are poorly understood. To study these relationships, spiny stellate neurons in the M- and P-recipient layers of V1, 4Calpha and 4Cbeta, respectively, were intracellularly labeled, and their axonal and dendritic arbors were reconstructed. We find that neurons with dendrites in upper layer 4Calpha project axons to layer 4B and CO blobs in layer 2/3, thus relaying M input to these regions. Other neurons in lower layer 4Calpha provide M input to interblobs. These cells have either (1) dendrites restricted to lower layer 4Calpha and axons specifically targeting layer 2/3 interblobs, or (2) dendrites in lower 4Calpha and 4Cbeta and axons targeting blobs and interblobs. P-recipient layer 4Cbeta neurons have dense axonal arbors in both blobs and interblobs but not layer 4B. Quantitative analyses reveal that 4Calpha cells provide approximately five times more synapses than 4Cbeta cells to layer 4B, whereas 4Cbeta cells provide five times more synapses than 4Calpha cells to layer 2/3. These observations imply that M input is dominant in layer 4B. In layer 2/3, both blobs and interblobs receive M and P input, but the P input is dominant, and M input to interblobs derives exclusively from a subpopulation of M afferents that targets lower 4Calpha, not from afferents targeting only upper 4Calpha (cf.Blasdel and Lund, 1983). We speculate that the M and P pathways to interblobs are \"X-like\" linear systems, whereas blobs also receive nonlinear \"Y-like\" M input."

            "In the primary visual cortex of macaque monkeys, laminar and columnar axonal specificity are correlated with functional differences between locations. We describe evidence that embedded within this anatomical framework is finer specificity of functional connections. Photostimulation-based mapping of functional input to 31 layer 3B neurons revealed that input sources to individual cells were highly diverse. Although some input differences were correlated with neuronal anatomy, no 2 neurons received excitatory input from the same cortical layers. Thus, input diversity reveals far more cell types than does anatomical diversity. This implies relatively little functional redundancy; despite trends related to laminar or columnar position, pools of neurons contributing uniquely to visual processing are likely relatively small. These results also imply that similarities in the anatomy of circuits in different cortical areas or species may not indicate similar functional connectivity."

        "abstract": [
            "Because layer 6 of the cerebral cortex receives direct thalamic input and provides projections back to the thalamus, it is in a unique position to influence thalamocortical interactions. Different types of layer 6 pyramidal neurons provide output to different thalamic nuclei, and it is therefore of interest to understand the sources of functional input to these neurons. We studied the morphologies and local excitatory input to individual layer 6 neurons in rat visual cortex by combining intracellular labeling and recording with laser-scanning photostimulation. As in previous photostimulation studies, we found significant differences in the sources of local excitatory input to different cell types. Most notably, there were differences in local input to neurons that, based on analogy to barrel cortex, are likely to project only to the lateral geniculate nucleus of the thalamus versus those that are likely to also project to the lateral posterior nucleus. The more striking finding, however, was the paucity of superficial layer input to layer 6 neurons in the rat visual cortex, contrasting sharply with layer 6 neurons in the primate visual cortex. These observations provide insight into differences in function between cortical projections to first-order versus higher-order thalamic nuclei and also show that these circuits can be organized differently in different species."

            "We developed a quantitative description of the circuits formed in cat area 17 by estimating the \"weight\" of the projections between different neuronal types. To achieve this, we made three-dimensional reconstructions of 39 single neurons and thalamic afferents labeled with horseradish peroxidase during intracellular recordings in vivo. These neurons served as representatives of the different types and provided the morphometrical data about the laminar distribution of the dendritic trees and synaptic boutons and the number of synapses formed by a given type of neuron. Extensive searches of the literature provided the estimates of numbers of the different neuronal types and their distribution across the cortical layers. Applying the simplification that synapses between different cell types are made in proportion to the boutons and dendrites that those cell types contribute to the neuropil in a given layer, we were able to estimate the probable source and number of synapses made between neurons in the six layers. The predicted synaptic maps were quantitatively close to the estimates derived from the experimental electron microscopic studies for the case of the main sources of excitatory and inhibitory input to the spiny stellate cells, which form a major target of layer 4 afferents. The map of the whole cortical circuit shows that there are very few \"strong\" but many \"weak\" excitatory projections, each of which may involve only a few percentage of the total complement of excitatory synapses of a single neuron."

        ], 
        "abstract": [
            "We injected tracer into wide regions of visual cortex in the cat to produce retrograde and orthograde labeling in the thalamus, chiefly in the lateral geniculate nucleus and lateral posterior-pulvinar complex (LP-Pulvinar). We used the electron microscope to measure the sizes of orthogradely labeled terminals in thalamus and used these measurements to help determine whether the terminals were \"RL\" (large, presumed excitatory) or \"RS\" (small, presumed excitatory). We also distinguished reciprocal regions, which were zones of corticothalamic feedback defined by the presence of many retrogradely labeled cell bodies and orthogradely labeled terminals, from nonreciprocal regions, which were zones of feedforward corticothalamic projections defined by the presence of orthogradely labeled terminals alone. The lateral geniculate nucleus, a reciprocal region, had retrogradely labeled cell bodies as well as labeled RS terminals. Likewise, reciprocal regions in LP-Pulvinar were dominated by labeled RS terminals. In contrast, nonreciprocal regions were dominated by labeled RL terminals. Based on other evidence of corticothalamic projections that RL and RS terminals derive, respectively, from layer 5 and layer 6, we suggest the same relationship here, leading to the conclusion that the corticothalamic input from layer 6 is largely feedback, whereas that from layer 5 is largely feedforward. This finding lends credence to a recent hypothesis that layer 5 corticothalamic axons represent the afferent limb of a cortico-thalamo-cortical pathway that is critical for corticocortical communication."

            "The cortical pathology in Alzheimer's disease (AD) should lead to the loss of effective interaction between distinct neocortical areas. This study compared 2 conditions within a single sensory integration task that differed in the demands placed on effective cross-cortical interaction. AD patients were impaired in their ability to bind distinct visual features of a stimulus when this binding placed greater demands on cross-cortical interaction (i.e., motion and color) but were not impaired when this binding placed lesser demands on such interaction (i.e., motion and luminance). In contrast, neurologically intact individuals and patients with Huntington's disease were able to effectively bind features under both conditions. These results provide psychophysical support for the presence of functional disconnectivity in AD and demonstrate the utility of AD for investigating the neurocognitive substrates of sensory integration."

        "abstract": [
            "We studied excitatory local circuits in the macaque primary visual cortex (VI) to investigate their relationships to the magnocellular (M) and parvocellular (P) streams. Sixty-two intracellularly labeled spiny neurons in layers 2-5 were analyzed. We made detailed observations of the laminar and columnar specificity of axonal arbors and noted correlations with dendritic arbors. We find evidence for considerable mixing of M and P streams by the local circuitry in VI. Such mixing is provided by neurons in the primary geniculate recipient layer 4C, as well as by neurons in both the supragranular and infragranular layers. We were also interested in possible differences in the axonal projections of neurons with different dendritic morphologies. We found that layer 4B spiny stellate and pyramidal neurons have similar axonal arbors. However, we identified two types of layer 5 pyramidal neuron. The majority have a conventional pyramidal dendritic morphology, a dense axonal arbor in layers 2.4B, and do not project to the white matter. Layer 5 projection neurons have an unusual \"backbranching\" dendritic morphology (apical dendritic branches arc downward rather than upward) and weak or no axonal arborization in layers 2-4B, but have long horizontal axonal projections in layer 5B. We find no strong projection from layer 5 pyramidal neurons to layer 6. In macaque V1 there appears to be no single source of strong local input to layer 6; only a minority of cells in layers 2-5 have axonal branches in layer 6 and these are sparse. Our results suggest that local circuits in V1 mediate interactions between M and P input that are complex and not easily incorporated into a simple framework."

        ], 
        "abstract": [
            "Using data that are available in various publications, a quantitative analysis has been made of the geniculocortical input to layer IVC of the macaque striate cortex. The data suggest that only 1.3-1.9% of the excitatory, or asymmetric synapses in layer IVC alpha of striate cortex are provided by the neurons of the magnocellular layers of the LGN. This amounts to only 18-40 of the 1000-2100 asymmetric synapses that the average layer IVC alpha neuron receives. The parvicellular afferents to layer IVC beta, on the other hand, provide 3.7-8.7% of the asymmetric synapses formed by the average layer IVC beta neuron, or 37-191 synapses to each neuron. If it is assumed that the boutons in the geniculocortical axonal plexuses are evenly spread, it can be calculated that the input to an individual layer IVC neuron is provided by some 24 axonal plexuses. This is regardless of whether the neuron lies in layer IVC alpha or in IVC beta. This calculation suggests that a single axonal plexus provides not more than one or two of the excitatory synapses received by an individual layer IVC alpha neuron, and between one and eight excitatory synapses for a layer IVC beta neuron. Consequently, it is unlikely that the response properties of a particular cortical neuron are dominated by its input from a single geniculate neuron. Since the geniculocortical input essentially determines the response properties of neurons in layer IV of macaque striate cortex, it is surprising that this input amounts to such a small number of synapses to an individual neuron, although we obtained a somewhat similar result in our earlier quantitative analysis of the geniculate input to the striate cortex of the cat (Peters and Payne, 1993). But it has to be questioned whether the low values obtained are correct. Interestingly, the geniculocortical input to cortex has been largely neglected in favor of analyses of intracortical circuitry, but in view of the basic importance of this afferent input, it is suggested that more quantitative data about it should be generated, so that a better assessment can be made of its extent."

        ], 
        "abstract": [
            "The mammalian neocortex contains two major classes of neurons, projection and local circuit neurons. Projection neurons contain the excitatory neurotransmitter glutamate, while local circuit neurons are inhibitory, containing GABA. The complex function of neocortical circuitry depends on the number and diversity of GABAergic (gamma-aminobutyric-acid-releasing) local circuit neurons. Using retroviral labelling in organotypic slice cultures of the embryonic human forebrain, we demonstrate the existence of two distinct lineages of neocortical GABAergic neurons. One lineage expresses Dlx1/2 and Mash1 transcription factors, represents 65% of neocortical GABAergic neurons in humans, and originates from Mash1-expressing progenitors of the neocortical ventricular and subventricular zone of the dorsal forebrain. The second lineage, characterized by the expression of Dlx1/2 but not Mash1, forms around 35% of the GABAergic neurons and originates from the ganglionic eminence of the ventral forebrain. We suggest that modifications in the expression pattern of transcription factors in the forebrain may underlie species-specific programmes for the generation of neocortical local circuit neurons and that distinct lineages of cortical interneurons may be differentially affected in genetic and acquired diseases of the human brain."

            "We present a technique for automatically assigning a neuroanatomical label to each voxel in an MRI volume based on probabilistic information automatically estimated from a manually labeled training set. In contrast to existing segmentation procedures that only label a small number of tissue classes, the current method assigns one of 37 labels to each voxel, including left and right caudate, putamen, pallidum, thalamus, lateral ventricles, hippocampus, and amygdala. The classification technique employs a registration procedure that is robust to anatomical variability, including the ventricular enlargement typically associated with neurological diseases and aging. The technique is shown to be comparable in accuracy to manual labeling, and of sufficient sensitivity to robustly detect changes in the volume of noncortical structures that presage the onset of probable Alzheimer's disease."

        "abstract": [
            "Accurate interpretation of functional MRI (fMRI) signals requires knowledge of the relationship between the hemodynamic response and the neuronal activity that underlies it. Here we address the question of coupling between pre- and postsynaptic neuronal activity and the hemodynamic response in rodent somatosensory (Barrel) cortex in response to single-whisker deflection. Using full-field multiwavelength optical imaging of hemoglobin oxygenation and electrophysiological recordings of spiking activity and local field potentials, we demonstrate that a point hemodynamic measure is influenced by neuronal activity across multiple cortical columns. We demonstrate that the hemodynamic response is a spatiotemporal convolution of the neuronal activation. Therefore, positive hemodynamic response in one cortical column might be explained by neuronal activity not only in that column but also in the neighboring columns. Thus, attempts at characterizing the neurovascular relationship based on point measurements of electrophysiology and hemodynamics may yield inconsistent results, depending on the spatial extent of neuronal activation. The finding that the hemodynamic signal observed at a given location is a function of electrophysiological activity over a broad spatial region helps explain a previously observed increase of local vascular response beyond the saturation of local neuronal activity. We also demonstrate that the oxy- and total-hemoglobin hemodynamic responses can be well approximated by space-time separable functions with an antagonistic center-surround spatial pattern extending over several millimeters. The surround \"negative\" hemodynamic activity did not correspond to observable changes in neuronal activity. The complex spatial integration of the hemodynamic response should be considered when interpreting fMRI data."

            "The human brain is dominated by the neocortex, a large folded surface, whose cellular and synaptic elements are arranged in layers. Since cortical structure is relatively constant across its surface, local information processing can be inferred from multiple laminar recordings of its electrical activity along a line perpendicular to its surface. Such recordings need to be spaced at least as close together as the cortical layers, and need to be wideband in order to sample both low frequency synaptic currents as well as high-frequency action potentials. Finally, any device used in the human brain must comply with strict safety standards. The current paper presents details of a system meeting these criteria, together with sample results obtained from epileptic subjects undergoing acute or chronic intracranial monitoring for definition of the epileptogenic region."

            "A neuronal network inspired by the anatomy of the cerebral cortex was simulated to study the self-organization of spiking neurons into neuronal groups. The network consisted of 100 000 reentrantly interconnected neurons exhibiting known types of cortical firing patterns, receptor kinetics, short-term plasticity and long-term spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP), as well as a distribution of axonal conduction delays. The dynamics of the network allowed us to study the fine temporal structure of emerging firing patterns with millisecond resolution. We found that the interplay between STDP and conduction delays gave rise to the spontaneous formation of neuronal groups--sets of strongly connected neurons capable of firing time-locked, although not necessarily synchronous, spikes. Despite the noise present in the model, such groups repeatedly generated patterns of activity with millisecond spike-timing precision. Exploration of the model allowed us to characterize various group properties, including spatial distribution, size, growth, rate of birth, lifespan, and persistence in the presence of synaptic turnover. Localized coherent input resulted in shifts of receptive and projective fields in the model similar to those observed in vivo."

            "Single-unit recording studies in the macaque have carefully documented the modulatory effects of attention on the response properties of visual cortical neurons. Attention produces qualitatively different effects on firing rate, depending on whether a stimulus appears alone or accompanied by distracters. Studies of contrast gain control in anesthetized mammals have found parallel patterns of results when the luminance contrast of a stimulus increases. This finding suggests that attention has co-opted the circuits that mediate contrast gain control and that it operates by increasing the effective contrast of the attended stimulus. Consistent with this idea, microstimulation of the frontal eye fields, one of several areas that control the allocation of spatial attention, induces spatially local increases in sensitivity both at the behavioral level and among neurons in area V4, where endogenously generated attention increases contrast sensitivity. Studies in the slice have begun to explain how modulatory signals might cause such increases in sensitivity."

The tuning of a neuron for an ITD is determined by the difference in axonal conduction delay from each ear--the so-called \"delay line\" hypothesis. Although studies in birds appear to support this model, recent evidence from mammals suggests that the model does not provide accurate descriptions of how ITDs are encoded in the mammalian auditory brainstem or of how ITD-sensitive neurons contribute to mammalian sound localization."

        "abstract": [
            "Although a columnar geometry is one of the defining features of cortical organization, major issues regarding its basic nature, key features, and functional significance remain unclear and often controversial. This review is intended to survey some of the basic anatomical features of columnar organization, and in particular the smaller scale dendritic minicolumns. One motive was simply to clarify what seem to be differences in terminology, where \"minicolumn\" can be used to refer to vertical rows of cells, pyramidal cell modules, or apical dendritic bundles. A second aim was to review anatomical details which over the years have tended increasingly to be overlooked. A third aim was to expand on recent results concerning the border of layers 1 and 2 as a specialized zone with its own micromodular organization. Views on columnar organization have arguably been heavily influenced by a desire for general principles; but re-examination of the complex underlying features may be both timely and worthwhile. We point out that what are defined as dendritic bundles do not extend through the full cortical thickness and are not strictly repetitive, but rather display significant inter- and intra-areal variation."

        ], 
        "abstract": [
            "The extent of intracortical arborization of individual thalamocortical axons in area 3b of the somatic sensory cortex and the degree of overlap in the cortical projections of relay cells in the ventral posterior nucleus of the thalamus were examined in macaque monkeys. Paired intracortical deposits of Fast blue (FB) and Diamidino yellow (DY) separated by 100-1500 microns were made by inserting crystals of dye into the tracks of tungsten microelectrodes used to record receptive field data on area 3b cells. Each injection gave retrograde labeling of one or more clusters of cells extending in elongated anteroposterior arrays through the ventral posterior medial (VPM) or ventral posterior lateral (VPL) nucleus. Double-labeled cells were only found when the distance between the centers of the dye deposits was less than 600 microns. With interdeposit distances greater than 600 microns, most clusters of retrogradely labeled cells had a majority of cells labeled by FB or DY. However, even with interdeposit distances of 1-1.5 mm the labeled clusters also contained significant numbers of cells labeled with the other dye. These results and an accompanying regression analysis indicate that the extent of intracortical arborization of single thalamocortical axons in area 3b is no greater than 600 microns. However, adjoining cells in the same part of the thalamic body representation can project to cortical targets as discrepant as 1.5 mm. It is proposed that the fine grain of the cortical representation depends upon inputs from the majority population of each thalamic cell cluster.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"

        "abstract": [
            "The integration of the whole cerebral cortex and thalamus during forebrain activities that underlie different states of consciousness, requires pathways for the dispersion of thalamic activity across many cortical areas. Past theories have relied on the intralaminar nuclei as the sources of diffuse thalamocortical projections that could facilitate spread of activity across the cortex. A case is made for the presence of a matrix of superficially-projecting cells, not confined to the intralaminar nuclei but extending throughout the whole thalamus. These cells are distinguished by immunoreactivity for the calcium-binding protein, D28K calbindin, are found in all thalamic nuclei of primates and have increased numbers in some nuclei. They project to superficial layers of the cerebral cortex over relatively wide areas, unconstrained by architectonic boundaries. They generally receive subcortical inputs that lack the topographic order and physiological precision of the principal sensory pathways. Superimposed upon the matrix in certain nuclei only, is a core of cells distinguished by immunoreactivity for another calcium-binding protein, parvalbumin, These project in highly ordered fashion to middle layers of the cortex in an area-specific manner. They are innervated by subcortical inputs that are topographically precise and have readily identifiable physiological properties. The parvalbumin cells form the basis for sensory and other inputs that are to be used as a basis for perception. The calbindin cells, especially when recruited by corticothalamic connections, can form a basis for the engagement of multiple cortical areas and thalamic nuclei that is essential for the binding of multiple aspects of sensory experience into a single framework of consciousness."

        "abstract": [
            "We attempt to summarize the properties of cortical synaptic connections and the precision with which they select their targets in the context of information processing in cortical circuits. High-frequency presynaptic bursts result in rapidly depressing responses at most inputs onto spiny cells and onto some interneurons. These 'phasic' connections detect novelty and changes in the firing rate, but report frequency of maintained activity poorly. By contrast, facilitating inputs to interneurons that target dendrites produce little or no response at low frequencies, but a facilitating-augmenting response to maintained firing. The neurons activated, the cells they in turn target and the properties of those synapses determine which parts of the circuit are recruited and in what temporal pattern. Inhibitory interneurons provide both temporal and spatial tuning. The 'forward' flow from layer-4 excitatory neurons to layer 3 and from 3 to 5 activates predominantly pyramids. 'Back' projections, from 3 to 4 and 5 to 3, do not activate excitatory cells, but target interneurons. Despite, therefore, an increasing complexity in the information integrated as it is processed through these layers, there is little 'contamination' by 'back' projections. That layer 6 acts both as a primary input layer feeding excitation 'forward' to excitatory cells in other layers and as a higher-order layer with more integrated response properties feeding inhibition to layer 4 is discussed."

        "abstract": [
            "Cortical areas are linked through pathways which originate and terminate in specific layers. The factors underlying which layers are involved in specific connections are not well understood. Here we tested whether cortical structure can predict the pattern as well as the relative distribution of projection neurons and axonal terminals in cortical layers, studied with retrograde and anterograde tracers. We used the prefrontal cortices in the rhesus monkey as a model system because their laminar organization varies systematically, ranging from areas that have only three identifiable layers, to those that have six layers. We rated each prefrontal area based on the number and definition of its cortical layers (level 1, lowest; level 5, highest). The structural model accurately predicted the laminar pattern of connections in approximately 80% of the cases. Thus, projection neurons from a higher-level cortex originated mostly in the upper layers and their axons terminated predominantly in the deep layers (4-6) of a lower-level cortex. Conversely, most projection neurons from a lower-level area originated in the deep layers and their axons terminated predominantly in the upper layers (1-3) of a higher-level area. In addition, the structural model accurately predicted that the proportion of projection neurons or axonal terminals in the upper to the deep layers would vary as a function of the number of levels between the connected cortices. The power of this structural model lies in its potential to predict patterns of connections in the human cortex, where invasive procedures are precluded."

        ], 
        "abstract": [
            "In recent years, many new cortical areas have been identified in the macaque monkey. The number of identified connections between areas has increased even more dramatically. We report here on (1) a summary of the layout of cortical areas associated with vision and with other modalities, (2) a computerized database for storing and representing large amounts of information on connectivity patterns, and (3) the application of these data to the analysis of hierarchical organization of the cerebral cortex. Our analysis concentrates on the visual system, which includes 25 neocortical areas that are predominantly or exclusively visual in function, plus an additional 7 areas that we regard as visual-association areas on the basis of their extensive visual inputs. A total of 305 connections among these 32 visual and visual-association areas have been reported. This represents 31% of the possible number of pathways if each area were connected with all others. The actual degree of connectivity is likely to be closer to 40%. The great majority of pathways involve reciprocal connections between areas. There are also extensive connections with cortical areas outside the visual system proper, including the somatosensory cortex, as well as neocortical, transitional, and archicortical regions in the temporal and frontal lobes. In the somatosensory/motor system, there are 62 identified pathways linking 13 cortical areas, suggesting an overall connectivity of about 40%. Based on the laminar patterns of connections between areas, we propose a hierarchy of visual areas and of somatosensory/motor areas that is more comprehensive than those suggested in other recent studies. The current version of the visual hierarchy includes 10 levels of cortical processing. Altogether, it contains 14 levels if one includes the retina and lateral geniculate nucleus at the bottom as well as the entorhinal cortex and hippocampus at the top. Within this hierarchy, there are multiple, intertwined processing streams, which, at a low level, are related to the compartmental organization of areas V1 and V2 and, at a high level, are related to the distinction between processing centers in the temporal and parietal lobes. However, there are some pathways and relationships (about 10% of the total) whose descriptions do not fit cleanly into this hierarchical scheme for one reason or another. In most instances, though, it is unclear whether these represent genuine exceptions to a strict hierarchy rather than inaccuracies or uncertainities in the reported assignment."

It receives afferents from the cerebellum, globus pallidus internus, and substantia nigra and projects mainly to the motor cortex, premotor cortex, and supplementary motor area. Various nomenclatures have been proposed to subdivide the motor thalamus, none of which are universally accepted. Both thalamic lesions and high-frequency stimulation ameliorate tremor in diverse pathological conditions. Modern neurophysiological techniques have allowed the recording of the activity of thalamic neurons in patients with different clinical conditions. This has provided a better understanding of the functions of the motor thalamus in humans. The aim of the present article is to briefly review the major anatomic and physiological aspects of the motor thalamus as well as the electrophysiological findings described in humans undergoing surgical procedures."

        ], 
        "abstract": [
            "The inhibitory thalamic reticular nucleus (TRN) intercepts and modulates all corticothalamic and thalamocortical communications. Previous studies showed that projections from sensory and motor cortices originate in layer VI and terminate as small boutons in central and caudal TRN. Here we show that prefrontal projections to TRN in rhesus monkeys have a different topographic organization and mode of termination. Prefrontal cortices projected mainly to the anterior TRN, at sites connected with the mediodorsal, ventral anterior, and anterior medial thalamic nuclei. However, projections from areas 46, 13, and 9 terminated widely in TRN and colocalized caudally with projections from temporal auditory, visual, and polymodal association cortices. Population analysis and serial EM reconstruction revealed two distinct classes of corticoreticular terminals synapsing with GABA/parvalbumin-positive dendritic shafts of TRN neurons. Most labeled boutons from prefrontal axons were small, but a second class of large boutons was also prominent. This is in contrast to the homogeneous small TRN terminations from sensory cortices noted previously and in the present study, which are thought to arise exclusively from layer VI. The two bouton types were often observed on the same axon, suggesting that both prefrontal layers V and VI could project to TRN. The dual mode of termination suggests a more complex role of prefrontal input in the functional regulation of TRN and gating of thalamic output back to the cortex. The targeting of sensory tiers of TRN by specific prefrontal areas may underlie attentional regulation for the selection of relevant sensory signals and suppression of distractors."

        "abstract": [
            "A sample of 84 neurons in lamina VIa of rat somatosensory cortex (S1) was juxtacellularly labeled with biocytin, and the axons of the neurons were traced. Three classes of cells were identified as corticothalamic, corticocortical, and local circuit neurons. Corticothalamic cells (46%) are small, short pyramids projecting either to the ventral posteromedial nucleus alone or to the posterior group as well. The former are in upper lamina VI, have apical dendrites terminating in layer IV, and have intracortical collaterals ascending to layer IV as a narrow column about the size of a barrel. The latter are in the lower half of lamina VI, have apical dendrites terminating in layer V, and have a more extensive network of collaterals terminating in the upper part of lamina V. Corticothalamic cells do not project to distant cortical targets through branching axons. Corticocortical cells (44%) are small, short pyramids, inverted or modified pyramids, or bipolar spiny neurons. They send collaterals principally to infragranular layers of S1 and branches to the second somatosensory cortex, the motor cortex, or the corpus callosum. Local circuit neurons (10%) are basket cells, concentrated in upper lamina VI, having smooth, beaded dendrites and a rich collateral network densely covered with varicosities in layers V and VI. We conclude that (1) dendritic morphology and axonal arborizations of corticothalamic cells relate to the projection target; (2) many apparently diverse layer VI cells project to other cortical fields; and (3) lamina VI is a network for corticothalamic and corticocortical communication."

            "This study was designed to explore the thalamic output of the globus pallidus (GP) and the pars reticulata (SNR) of the substantia nigra (SN) upon the reticular thalamic nucleus (Rt) in the rat. Thus, 13 animals were deeply anesthetized and stereotaxically injected with horseradish peroxidase (HRP) conjugated with wheat germ agglutinin (HRP-WGA) mixed with HRP free in different portions of GP and SN. Next, we evaluated the anterograde terminal labeling in the rostral two-thirds of Rt. Confirmatory results were obtained in our case material about the entity of GP reticular projections, and some new data are presented here regarding the projections from GP and SNR upon Rt. Among them we emphasize the following for the rostral two-thirds of this thalamic nucleus: a) the projections from GP are more abundant than those arising from SNR; b) a dorsoventral topographical design appears to be clear in the organization of the afferent connections from GP to Rt; c) SNR projects more abundantly to the ventral sectors of Rt; and d) the central core of Rt is more innervated by GP than by SNR, which innervates Rt mainly in its peripheral portions. These results raise the possibility of multiple and differentiated assignments of the output nuclei of the basal ganglia upon the thalamus and its connectivity."

        ], 
        "abstract": [
            "The objectives of this study were, on one hand, to better understand how the segregated functional pathways from the cerebral cortex through the striatopallidal complex emerged in the projections to the thalamus and, on the other hand, to compare the ultrastructure and synaptic organization of the pallidal efferents to the ventrolateral (VL) and centromedian (CM) thalamic nuclei in primates. These aims were achieved by injections of the retrograde-anterograde tracer, biotinylated dextran amine (BDA), in different functional regions of the internal pallidum (GPi) in squirrel monkeys. The location of retrogradely labelled cells in the striatum was determined to ascertain the functional specificity of the injection sites. Injections in the ventrolateral two-thirds of the GPi (group 1) led to retrograde labelling in the postcommissural region of the putamen (\"sensorimotor striatum\") and plexuses of labelled fibers in the rostral one-third of the principal ventrolateral nucleus (VLp) and the central part of the CM. On the other hand, injections in the dorsal one-third (group 3) and the rostromedial pole (group 4) of the GPi led to retrogradely labelled cells in the body of the caudate nucleus (\"associative striatum\") and the ventral striatum (\"limbic striatum\"), respectively. After those injections, dense plexuses of anterogradely labelled varicosities were found in common thalamic nuclei, including the parvocellular ventral anterior nucleus (VApc), the dorsal VL (VLd), and the rostrodorsal part of the parafascicular nucleus (PF). In the caudal two-thirds of the CM/PF, the labelled fibers formed a band that lay along the dorsal border of the complex in a region called the dorsolateral PF (PFdl) in this study. The ventromedial nucleus (VM) was densely labelled only after injections in the rostromedial GPi, whereas the dorsal part of the zona incerta was labelled in both groups. At the electron microscopic level, the BDA-positive terminals in the VLp were larger and more elongated than those in the CM but, overall, displayed the same pattern of synaptic organization. Our findings indicate 1) that some associative and limbic cortical information, which is largely processed in segregated corticostriatopallidal channels, converges to common thalamic nuclei and 2) that the PF is a major target of associative and limbic GPi efferents in monkeys."

            "The neuropsychiatry of Parkinson's disease (PD) and its correlates are reviewed. Dementia occurs in up to 30% and can be treated with cholinesterase inhibitors. Cognitive impairments involve executive, visuospatial, attentional, and memory dysfunctions. Apathy may respond to dopamine agonists or cholines-terase inhibitors. Cognitive impairment, psychosis, and depression predict quality of life. Visual hallucinations and paranoia are common, and respond to low dose clozapine. Depression is common and predicts caregiver burden and depression. The best data suggest the efficacy of nortriptyline and the safety of SSRIs. Anxiety disorders occur in 40% of patients, especially off-period panic attacks and specific phobias. Bromazepam has proven useful for anxiety in PD, but buspirone has only diminished drug-induced dyskinesias to date. Sleep disorders occur in up to 94% of patients. Insomnia is common and is treated by dopaminergic agent dose reduction, nocturnal dosing, treatment of depression, or use of short half-lived hypnotics, depending on etiology. Parasomnias include REM behavior disorder and vivid dreams and nightmares. Excessive daytime somnolence occurs in at least 15% of patients. Sleep attacks are common and patients should be warned about driving when taking dopamine agonists. Sexual disorders occur in most patients. Paraphilias are associated with dopamine agonists, and clozapine may be useful in their treatment. Surgical therapies are associated with a wide variety of neuropsychiatric features, and vigilance for suicide attempts with subthalamic nucleus stimulation seems warranted. Neuropsychiatric disorders are important determinants of quality of life and caregiver burden in PD. More clinical research is needed to establish effective treatments."

        "abstract": [
            "Prefrontostriatal and prefrontothalamic connections in rhesus monkeys have been shown to be organized in a topographic manner. These projections originate largely from infragranular layers V and VI. To examine whether the striatal and thalamic connections from the prefrontal cortex arise from separate neuronal populations or are collateralized, two different fluorescent retrograde tracers (diamidino yellow and fast blue) were injected into topographically similar regions of the head of the caudate nucleus and the mediodorsal nucleus in the same animal. The results show that although prefrontostriatal and prefrontothalamic projections arise from similar topographic regions, their laminar origins are distinctive. The connections to the head of the caudate nucleus originate mainly from layer Va, to a lesser extent from layer Vb, with a minor contribution from layers III and VI. In contrast, the projections to the mediodorsal nucleus emanate largely from layer VI, and also from layer Vb. Only occasional double-labeled neurons were observed, indicating that prefrontostriatal and prefrontothalamic connections originate from separate neuronal populations. The differential laminar distributions of neurons projecting to the head of the caudate nucleus and the mediodorsal nucleus suggest that these structures may receive independent types of information from the prefrontal cortex."

        "abstract": [
            "The mammalian cerebral cortex is composed of individual layers characterized by the cell types they contain and their afferent and efferent connections. The current study examined the raw, and size-normalized, laminar thicknesses in three cortical regions (somatosensory, motor, and premotor) of fourteen species from three orders of mammals: primates, carnivores, and rodents. The proportional size of the pyramidal cell layers (supra- and infragranular) varied between orders but was similar within orders despite wide variance in absolute cortical thickness. Further, supragranular layer thickness was largest in primates (46 +/- 3 percent), followed by carnivores (36 +/- 3 percent), and then rodents (19 +/- 4 percent), suggesting a distinct difference in the proportion of cortex devoted to corticocortical connectivity across these orders. Although measures of supragranular layer thickness are highly correlated with measures of overall brain size, such associations are not present when independent contrasts are used to control for phylogenetic inertia. Interestingly, neurogenesis time span remains strongly associated with supragranular layer thickness despite size normalization and controlling for phylogenetic inertia. Such layering differences between orders, and similarities amongst species within an order, suggest that supragranular layer expansion may have occurred early in mammalian evolution and may be related to ontogenetic variables such as neurogenesis time span rather than measures of overall size."

        ], 
        "abstract": [
            "Paired intracellular recordings in slices of adult rat neocortex with biocytin filling of synaptically connected neurons were used to investigate the pyramidal targets, in layer V, of layer III pyramidal axons. The time-course and sensitivity of excitatory postsynaptic potentials to current injected at the soma, and locations of close appositions between presynaptic axons and postsynaptic dendrites, indicated that the majority of contributory synapses were located in layer V. Within a \"column\" of tissue, radius < or = 250 microm, the probability that a randomly selected layer III pyramid innervated a layer V pyramid was 1 in 4 if the target cell was a burst firing pyramid with an apical dendritic tuft in layers II/I. If, however, the potential target was a regular spiking pyramid, the probability of connectivity was only 1 in 40, and none of the 13 anatomically identified postsynaptic layer V targets had a slender apical dendrite terminating in layers IV/III. Morphological reconstructions indicated that layer III pyramids select target layer V cells whose apical dendrites pass within 50-100 microm of the soma of the presynaptic pyramid in layer III and which have overlapping apical dendritic tufts in the superficial layers. The probability that a layer V cell would innervate a layer III pyramid lying within 250 microm of its apical dendrite was much lower (one in 58). Both presynaptic layer III pyramids and their large postsynaptic layer V targets could therefore access similar inputs in layers I/II, while small layer V pyramids could not. One prediction from the present data would be that neither descending layer V inputs to the striatum or thalamus, nor transcallosal connections would be readily activated by longer distance cortico-cortical \"feedback\" connections that terminated in layers I/II. These could, however, activate corticofugal pathways to the superior colliculus or pons, both directly and via layer III."

        "abstract": [
            "To determine the organization of visual inputs and outputs of the striatum, we placed multiple retrograde and anterograde tracers into physiologically identified portions of the striatum known to receive inputs from visual cortex in seven macaques. The injection sites included the tail and genu of the caudate nucleus (14 cases), the head of the caudate (1 case), and the ventral putamen (3 cases). Retrogradely labeled cells were located predominantly in layer 5 of the ipsilateral cortex but were also found in layers 3 and 6. After caudate injections, labeled cells were found both in large, nearly continuous regions of cortex topographically related to the site of the injection, and in several smaller cortical regions that were discontinuous and common to many or all of the injection sites. The continuously labeled regions included nearly all known visual cortical areas, except for the striate cortex. After injections in the rostral tail, the continuously labeled region included the rostral portion of Bonin and Bailey's (Urbana: University of Illinois Press. '47) area TE and adjacent portions of TF, TH, TG, and, occasionally, area 35 (Brodmann, Leipzig: J.A. Barth. '09). After injections into the posterior tail and ventral genu, the labeled region shifted posteriorly in TE and TF, and into TEO and the ventral parts of prestriate areas V4, V3, and (sparsely) V2. As the injection site was advanced into the dorsal genu, the labeled region shifted dorsally toward the parietal lobe, including prestriate areas MT and PO, parietal area PG (Brodmann's area 7), the ventral and lateral intraparietal sulcal areas (VIP and LIP, respectively), and area PE and adjacent area LC (Brodmann's areas 5 and 23, respectively). The discontinuous areas labeled by many different injections included the principal sulcus/frontal eye field region, the anterior cingulate cortex, and the superior temporal polysensory area. Thus, whereas temporal, occipital, and parietal visual cortical areas project into the caudate largely according to proximity, certain multimodal cortical areas seem to have a much wider projection. To determine whether visual cortical areas have additional projections to the caudate beyond the territory of our retrograde injection sites in the tail and genu. 3H-labeled amino acids were injected into areas TE, V4, and MT in three additional monkeys. The topographic location of label in the tail and genu of the caudate in these cases was consistent with the results from injections of retrograde tracers into the caudate.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"

            "The projections of the superior temporal gyrus to the caudate nucleus were studied in 10 squirrel monkeys (Saimiri sciureus). It was found that the primary auditory cortex lacks direct connections with the caudate nucleus as well as the putamen. Areas RL and T1 of Burton and Jones, bordering the primary auditory cortex laterally, show a moderate projection to the body and tail of the caudate nucleus; area T2, bordering areas RL and T1, shows an extensive projection into the head, body and tail. A comparison of the temporo-caudate projections of the monkey with those of rodents and carnivores suggests that primary and secondary auditory cortices differ in their connections in primates more than in other mammals, pointing to a greater functional differentiation of these areas in primates."

        "abstract": [
            "The number and proportion of neurons displaying GABA immunoreactivity were determined for 50-micron-wide columns through the thickness of 10 areas of monkey cerebral cortex, including the precentral motor area (area 4), 3 cytoarchitectonic fields of the first somatic sensory area (areas 3b, 1, and 2), 2 areas of parietal association cortex (areas 5 and 7), the first and second visual areas (areas 17 and 18), area 21 of the temporal lobe, and areas of the orbital and lateral frontal cortex. Methods of fixation and immunocytochemical processing were designed to maximize the number of stained cells in 15-micron-thick frozen sections and 1-micron-thick plastic sections. In 8 of the 10 areas the number and proportion of GABA-immunoreactive neurons per 50-micron-wide column were found to be the same (34-43 cells/column; 25% of the total neuronal population). Areas 17 and 3b differed. Area 17 contained 50% more GABA-immunoreactive neurons (52-66 cells/column) but more than twice the total number of neurons, so that the GABA cells made up less than 20% of the total. In 3 monkeys, the number and proportion of GABA-positive neurons per 50-micron-wide column in area 3b were smaller than in adjacent areas of sensorimotor cortex (26-42 cells/column; 19-22%). In 2 other monkeys, the number and proportion (34-43 cells/column; 24-26%) were the same as in adjacent areas. Despite the similarity among most areas of monkey cortex, within some areas, the number of GABA-positive neurons per 50-micron-wide column varied as much as 30%. These variations form a significant, repeating pattern only in area 18, where narrow bands (150-200 micron wide) of relatively few stained cells alternated with either narrow or wide bands (600-700 micron wide) in which columns contained more cells. The GABA-immunoreactive neurons were unevenly distributed across layers, with every area containing large numbers and proportions of stained cells in layer II, and every area but area 4 displaying a second concentration in the principal thalamocortical recipient layers. In area 4, the number of GABA-positive neurons declined sharply from layer II to layer III and remained low through layer VI. For areas displaying the greatest intra-areal variability, only 1 or 2 layers contributed significantly to that variability (layer IV in area 3b, layers III and V in area 18, and layers II and III in area 17).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"

            "To understand the dendritic differentiation in various types of cortical nonpyramidal cells, we analyzed quantitatively their dendritic branching and spine expression. The dendritic internode and interspine interval obeyed exponential distributions with type-specific decay constants. The initial branching pattern, internode interval and spine density at the light microscopic level divided nonpyramidal cells into three dendritic types, correlated with axonal, neurochemical and firing types. The initial branching pattern determined the overall vertical spread of dendrites. Basket cell subtypes with different firing and chemical expression patterns were distinct in the vertical and horizontal spatial spread, providing diverse input territories. Internode densities of dendritic spines, as well as those of axonal synaptic boutons, did not correlate with the tortuosities and intervals, suggesting a tendency to distribute synapses homogeneously over the arbor. Dendritic spines identified at the electron microscopic level were different in length and shape among subtypes. Although the density was lower than that of pyramidal cells, spines themselves were also composed of several morphological types such as mushroom and multihead ones, which were expressed differentially among subtypes. Correlation of dendritic branching characteristics with differences in spine structure suggests distinct ways to receive specific inputs among the subtypes."

        "abstract": [
            "The aim of this study was to investigate the vertical organization of axons and pyramidal cells in area 18, and to compare it with that in area 17. In area 18 there are regularly spaced vertical bundles of myelinated axons that have an average center-to-center spacing of 21 microns. This arrangement of axons resembles that in area 17. Pyramidal cells in area 18 and their apical dendrites are less regularly arranged. The apical dendrites of the pyramidal cells of layer 6A aggregate with those from layer 5 pyramids to form swathes of apical dendrites that pass into layer 4. There they are joined by the apical dendrites of the small layer 4 pyramids, so that much of the neuropil of layer 4 is occupied by apical dendrites. Most of these apical dendrites form their terminal tufts in layer 3. Very few of them reach layer 1, which is dominated by the apical dendrites of layer 2/3 pyramids. Thus, there are two tiers of apical dendrites and their apical tufts, a deep one formed by the layer 4, 5 and 6 apical dendrites that terminate in layer 3, and a second one formed by the apical dendrites of layer 2/3 pyramids that terminate in layer 1. In contrast, in area 17 the apical dendrites of layer 5 pyramids form discrete clusters that have a center-to-center spacing of 23 microns. These clusters are joined by the apical dendrites of the layer 2/3 pyramids and all of these apical dendrites form their apical tufts in layer 1. Based upon the dispositions of the apical dendrites of the pyramidal cells in area 17 and 18, we speculate that the influences of, and the interactions between, the feed-forward and feed-back signals in the two areas are quite different, because in the two areas different postsynaptic targets are available to these afferents."

            "Properties of local synaptic connections in neocortex, studied with dual intracellular recordings in vitro and correlated with cell and synaptic morphology are summarized. The different durations and sensitivities to somatic membrane potential of pyramid-pyramid excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs) apparently reflect the positions of the synapses on the postsynaptic dendrites. Their time-, frequency- and voltage-dependent properties enable supra-linear summation of several low-frequency inputs arising in the same dendritic region, even if only loosely coincident, but they depress during repetitive firing in any one input. Pyramidal input to classical fast spiking and low threshold spiking interneurones are strikingly different. Here low presynaptic firing rates results in many transmission failures. EPSPs are brief and inputs must be near coincident for summation. However, these synapses display pronounced. frequency-dependent, incrementing facilitation at higher presynaptic frequencies. Once initiated by a brief high-frequency burst, this facilitation is maintained at lower frequencies. GABAA receptor-mediated inhibitory postsynaptic potentials (IPSPs) arising proximally are of very different durations depending on the type of interneurone activated and can prevent and subsequently synchronize firing in their many postsynaptic partners with very different delays (eg. 10-100 ms). Low threshold spiking interneurones, in contrast, generate brief IPSPs only in more distal dendritic regions and have little effect on somatic excitability acting to shunt input distally."

        "abstract": [
            "Intrinsic connections in the inferior temporal cortex were analyzed by making extracellular injections of biocytin in Japanese macaques. Analysis was focused mainly on the dorsal part of area TE, in which a functional columnar organization has been shown. Interlaminar connections were analyzed in coronal section after laminar-specific microinjections, and intralaminar connections were examined from tangential sections. After injections at various depths in the dorsal TE, both axons and cell bodies were strongly labeled above or below the injection site in a columnar appearance. Axons from layer 3 ran in bundles towards the white matter and gave off prominent collaterals in layer 5. Ascending axons from lower to upper layers were also present (e.g., layers 4, 5, and 6 to layer 3). In tangential sections, there were abundant axons running parallel to the pia mater. These horizontal axons, particularly those in layers 2 and 3, produced patches of terminals 0.5 +/- 0.1 mm (mean +/- s.d.) in size and cylindrical in shape, spanning layers 1-3 or even to layers 4 and 5. In the tangential plane, they were distributed in an anisotropic manner around the injection. The farthest patch appeared at 4 mm from the injection site. The center-to-center distance between nearest-neighbor patches was 0.7 +/- 0.3 mm. These patches were found only within the dorsal TE and did not extend into the lower bank of the superior temporal sulcus or into the ventral part of area TE. Area TEO, which is a major afferent source to area TE, had axonal patches with spacing similar to those in area TE but with smaller sizes (0.4 +/- 0.1 mm). The results show that intrinsic horizontal axons both in area TE and in area TEO arborize in a patchy manner, as has been reported for several other cortical areas. In are TE, the size and spacing of the terminal patches match those of columns with similar stimulus selectivity. Thus, these patches may be related to the functional modularity in area TE. Vertical connections across layers and cylindrical patches of horizontal axons most likely contribute to the shared stimulus selectivity among cells within a column."

        ], 
        "abstract": [
            "The axonal projections arising from the forelimb area of the primary motor cortex (M1) in cynomolgus monkeys (Macaca fascicularis) were studied following microiontophoretic injections of biotinylated dextran amine under electrophysiological guidance. The microinjections were centered on layer V, and 42 anterogradely labeled corticofugal axons were reconstructed from serial frontal or sagittal sections with a camera lucida. Our investigation shows that the primate striatum receives both direct and indirect projections from M1. The direct corticostriatal projection is formed by axons that remain uniformly thin and unbranched throughout their sinuous trajectory to the ipsilateral striatum. They divide as they enter the dorsolateral sector of the post-commissural putamen, the so-called sensorimotor striatal territory. The indirect corticostriatal projection derives from a thin collateral emitted within the corona radiata by thick, long-range fibers that descend toward the brainstem. The collateral enters the putamen dorsomedially and remains unbranched until it reaches the dorsolateral sector of the putamen, where it breaks out into two to four axonal branches displaying small and equally spaced varicosities. Both direct and indirect corticostriatal axons branch moderately but occupy vast rostrocaudal striatal territories, where they appear to contact en passant several widely distributed striatal neurons. These findings reveal that, in contrast to current beliefs, the primate motor corticostriatal system is not exclusively formed by axons dedicated solely to the striatum. It also comprises collaterals from long-range corticofugal axons, which can thus provide to the striatum a copy of the neural information that is being conveyed to the brainstem and/or spinal cord."

        ], 
        "abstract": [
            "The organization of the projections from the cingulate cortex to the striatum in the monkey was studied using the retrograde tracers Lucifer Yellow conjugated to dextran amines and horseradish peroxidase conjugated to wheat germ agglutinin. These tracers were injected into the different regions of the ventral (limbic) striatum and the dorsal (sensorimotor) striatum. The shell region of the nucleus accumbens was defined using calbindin-D28K immunohistochemistry. Following injections into the ventral striatum, there are numerous retrogradely labeled neurons in the various regions of the primate cingulate cortex, most of which are derived from layer V. The cytoarchitectural subdivisions of cingulate cortex include the anterior cingulate cortex, areas 25, 24a-c, and 24a'-c', and the posterior cingulate cortex, areas 23a-c, 29, 30, and 31. There is a topographical organization of the projections from these different cingulate areas to the ventral and dorsal striatum. The medial ventral striatum receives input from the rostral part of the anterior cingulate cortex (areas 25 and 24a,b). The shell region of the nucleus accumbens receives fibers from areas 25, 24a,b, and 24a',b'. Projections to the central ventral striatum including the core of the nucleus accumbens are derived primarily from areas 25, 24a, 24b, and the medial part of area 24c. However, few labeled cells are detected in areas 24c and 24c'. The lateral ventral striatum receives input primarily from areas 24b, 24b' and 23b and medial portion of area 24c. The medial ventral striatum and the shell of the nucleus accumbens have a similar distribution of labeled cells, such that these regions derive their input almost entirely from the rostral anterior cingulate cortex. In contrast to the ventral striatum, the dorsal sensorimotor striatum receives projections from areas 24c, 24c' 23c and 31. These arise primarily from the lateral portion of lower bank and the fundus of the cingulate sulcus. Our results demonstrate that areas 24c, 24c' and 23c, the lateral portion of the lower bank and the fundus of the cingulate sulcus project to the dorsal sensorimotor striatum. The medial portion of the lower bank of the cingulate cortex projects to the ventral striatum including the core of the nucleus accumbens. Different projections to striatum from discrete subdivisions of cingulate cortex indicate that these areas are heterogeneous and have different functions such that the fundus of the cingulate sulcus is related to skeletomotor function, whereas the medial portion of the lower bank of the cingulate sulcus is associated with the limbic-related and association cortical function.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"

        "abstract": [
            "The modular organization of nervous systems is a widely documented principle of design for both vertebrate and invertebrate brains of which the columnar organization of the neocortex is an example. The classical cytoarchitectural areas of the neocortex are composed of smaller units, local neural circuits repeated iteratively within each area. Modules may vary in cell type and number, in internal and external connectivity, and in mode of neuronal processing between different large entities; within any single large entity they have a basic similarity of internal design and operation. Modules are most commonly grouped into entities by sets of dominating external connections. This unifying factor is most obvious for the heterotypical sensory and motor areas of the neocortex. Columnar defining factors in homotypical areas are generated, in part, within the cortex itself. The set of all modules composing such an entity may be fractionated into different modular subsets by different extrinsic connections. Linkages between them and subsets in other large entities form distributed systems. The neighborhood relations between connected subsets of modules in different entities result in nested distributed systems that serve distributed functions. A cortical area defined in classical cytoarchitectural terms may belong to more than one and sometimes to several distributed systems. Columns in cytoarchitectural areas located at some distance from one another, but with some common properties, may be linked by long-range, intracortical connections."

We find that, as has long been suspected by cortical neuroanatomists, the same basic laminar and tangential organization of the excitatory neurons of the neocortex is evident wherever it has been sought. Similarly, the inhibitory neurons show characteristic morphology and patterns of connections throughout the neocortex. We offer a simple model of cortical processing that is consistent with the major features of cortical circuits: The superficial layer neurons within local patches of cortex, and within areas, cooperate to explore all possible interpretations of different cortical input and cooperatively select an interpretation consistent with their various cortical and subcortical inputs."

            "In this brief review of inter-laminar synaptic connections in neocortex a case is made for the hypothesis that axons select their targets, or neurones select their inputs with great specificity. A large part of the data discussed was obtained from dual intracellular recordings in slices of adult neocortex. The neurones innervated in a given layer by a given type of axon were not found to be a random selection of the cells in that layer. Rather in a layer to layer specific fashion, certain types of target cells are densely innervated while others are not contacted or receive only weak inputs. In another layer, the same axons may select other targets."

            "We report the existence and distribution of an unusual type of projection neuron, a large, spindle-shaped cell, in layer Vb of the anterior cingulate cortex of pongids and hominids. These spindle cells were not observed in any other primate species or any other mammalian taxa, and their volume was correlated with brain volume residuals, a measure of encephalization in higher primates. These observations are of particular interest when considering primate neocortical evolution, as they reveal possible adaptive changes and functional modifications over the last 15-20 million years in the anterior cingulate cortex, a region that plays a major role in the regulation of many aspects of autonomic function and of certain cognitive processes. That in humans these unique neurons have been shown previously to be severely affected in the degenerative process of Alzheimer's disease suggests that some of the differential neuronal susceptibility that occurs in the human brain in the course of age-related dementing illnesses may have appeared only recently during primate evolution."

            "Corticostriatal pyramidal cells are heterogeneous in the frontal cortex. Here, we show that subpopulations of corticostriatal neurons in the rat frontal cortex are selectively connected with each other based on their subcortical targets. Using paired recordings of retrogradely labeled cells, we investigated the synaptic connectivity between two projection cell types: those projecting to the pons [corticopontine (CPn) cell], often with collaterals to the striatum, and those projecting to both sides of the striatum but not to the pons [crossed corticostriatal (CCS) cell]. The two types were morphologically differentiated in regard to their apical tufts. The dendritic morphologies of CCS cells were correlated with their somatic depth within the cortex. CCS cells had reciprocal synaptic connections with each other and also provided synaptic input to CPn cells. However, connections from CPn to CCS cells were rarely found, even in pairs showing CCS to CPn connectivity. Additionally, CCS cells preferentially innervated the basal dendrites of other CCS cells but made contacts onto both the basal and apical dendrites of CPn cells. The amplitude of synaptic responses was to some extent correlated with the contact site number. Ratios of the EPSC amplitude to the contact number tended to be larger in the CCS to CCS connection. Therefore, our data demonstrate that these two types of corticostriatal cells distinct in their dendritic morphologies show directional and domain-dependent preferences in their synaptic connectivity."

        "abstract": [
            "The distribution and terminal morphology of the corticothalamic projection originating from the primary auditory cortex (A1) were established in a macaque monkey, using the anterograde (and retrograde) tracer biotinylated dextran amine. A dense corticothalamic projection from A1 was found in the ventral (vMGB) and dorsal (dMGB) divisions of the medial geniculate body and, to a lesser extent, in the medial division (mMGB), the posterior thalamic nucleus (PO) and the suprageniculate nucleus. Most terminal boutons were small (<1 microm), except some large boutons (2-6 microm) located in PO and vMGB. The data demonstrate that the corticothalamic projection from A1 in primate consists of two types of terminals (small and giant endings) in line with previous observations in rat and cat. Retrogradely labeled thalamocortical neurons formed clusters generally overlapping the corticothalamic terminal fields."

            "The nature of cerebral cortical circuitry has been increasingly clarified by markers for the identification of precise cell types with specific morphology, connectivity and distinct physiological properties. Molecular markers are not only helpful in dissecting cortical circuitry, but also give insight into the mechanisms of cortical neuronal specification and differentiation. The two principal neuronal types of the cerebral cortex are the pyramidal and GABAergic cells. Pyramidal cells are excitatory and project to distant targets, while GABAergic neurons are mostly inhibitory non-pyramidal interneurons. Reliable markers for specific subtypes of interneurons are available and have been employed in the classification and functional analysis of cortical circuitry. Until recently, cortical pyramidal neurons have been considered a homogeneous class of cells. This concept is now changing as the powerful tools of molecular biology and genetics identify molecular tags for subtypes of pyramidal cells such as: Otx-1 [Frantz, G.D., Bohner, A.P., Akers, R.M., McConnell, S.K., 1994.

These genes outline the numerous subtypes of pyramidal cells and are increasingly refining our previous classifications. They also indicate specific developmental programs operate in cell fate decisions. This review will describe the progress made on the correlation of these markers to each other within a specific subtype of layer V neurons with identified, stereotypic projections. Further work is needed to link these data with observations on somatodendritic morphology and physiological properties. The integrated molecular, anatomical and physiological characterisation of pyramidal neurons will lead to a much better appreciation of functional cortical circuits."

            "Evidence has been accumulating that the primate cerebellum contributes not only to motor control, but also to higher 'cognitive' function. However, there is no consensus about how the cerebellum processes such information. The answer to this puzzle can be found in the nature of cerebellar connections to areas of the cerebral cortex (particularly the prefrontal cortex) and in the uniformity of its intrinsic cellular organization, which implies uniformity in information processing regardless of the area of origin in the cerebral cortex. With this in mind, the relatively well-developed models of how the cerebellum processes information from the motor cortex might be extended to explain how it could also process information from the prefrontal cortex."

        "abstract": [
            "The terminal distribution of thalamic afferents in primate prefrontal cortex has never been examined in any detail. In the present study, WGA-HRP was injected into major subdivisions of the mediodorsal nucleus (MD) in the rhesus monkey in order to determine 1) The areal distribution of MD projections, 2) the layer(s) in which MD afferents terminate, 3) the tangential pattern of the MD axonal terminals, 4) the cells of origin of the reciprocal corticothalamic pathway, and 5) the degree of reciprocity between the corticothalamic and thalamocortical pathways in the different regions of the prefrontal cortex. As expected on the basis of retrograde degeneration and transport studies, injections centered in the magnocellular (MDmc) subnucleus of MD labeled cells and terminals in the ventral and medial prefrontal cortex. Injections involving ventral MDmc labeled the more lateral of these areas (Walker's areas 11 and 12); injections of the dorsal MDmc labeled the ventromedial regions (areas 13 and 14). In contrast, injections involving mainly the lateral, parvicellular (MDpc) moiety labeled cells and terminals in dorsolateral and dorsomedial areas (Walker's 46, 9, and 8B). Area 8A was labeled most prominently when injections included the multiform portion of MD (MDmf) and area 10 had connections with anterior portions of MD. A dorsal-ventral topography for MDpc exists with dorsal MDpc labeling dorsal and dorsomedial prefrontal areas and ventral MDpc labeling dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. Our findings with respect to MD are consistent with a nucleus-to-field organization of its thalamocortical projection system. Outside of the traditional boundaries of prefrontal cortex, lateral MD projections extended to the supplementary motor area (SMA) and the dorsal part of the anterior cingulate (AC) whereas the medial MD projection targeted the ventromedial cingulate cortex and spared SMA. In addition, a few labeled cells and sparse terminals were found in the inferior parietal lobule, the superior temporal sulcus, and the anterior part of the insula after injections that involved the medial part of MD. Labeled terminals were invariably confined to layer IV and adjacent deep layer III. No terminal label was ever observed in layers I, II, superficial III, V, or VI in any part of the cerebral cortex following injections confined to any part of MD.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"

        "abstract": [
            "The cat's dorsocaudal claustrum was studied in Golgi preparations, by electron microscopy, and by anterograde and retrograde tracer techniques. It receives a convergent retinotopic projection from several visual cortical ares, including areas 17, 18, 19, 21a and PMLS (posteromedial lateral suprasylvian area). The projection arises from spiny dendrite cells (pyramidal and fusiform) in the middle of cortical layer VI. As shown by a double label experiment, they form a separate population from those projecting to the lateral geniculate nucleus. There are also inputs from the lateral hypothalamus, from the nucleus centralis thalami, and probably from the locus coeruleus, but not from the sensory nuclei of the thalamus. Non-visual cortical areas do not project to the visual claustrum, but many of them are connected to other parts of the nucleus. For example, the splenial (cingulate) gyrus projects to a claustral zone just ventral to the visual area, and regions anterior to the visual area are connected with somatosensory and auditory cortex. The commonest cell type in the claustrum is a large spiny dendrite neuron whose axon leaves the nucleus after giving off local collaterals. Small spine-free cells, with beaded dendrites and a locally arborizing axon, are found also. Electron microscopy of the claustrum after ablation of the visual cortex showed degenerating type 1 axon terminals synapsing on spines and beaded dendrites, suggesting a direct cortical input to both cell types. The visual claustrum projects back to the visual cortex, to the same areas from which it receives an input. The return projection is predominantly ipsilateral, but there is, in addition, a small crossed projection. The claustrocortical axons terminate in all cortical layers but most heavily in layers IV and VI. The majority of the cells in the visual claustrum project to the cortex, and retinotopy is maintained throughout the entire corticoclaustral loop. No subcortical projections from the claustrum could be identified."

        "abstract": [
            "Recent evidence indicates that corticotectal neurons belong to only one of the three morphological classes of pyramidal cells in layer V. The present study compares the dendritic morphology and axon collaterals of corticotectal, corticopontine, and layer V callosal neurons by using techniques based on the retrograde transport of horseradish peroxidase and fluorescent dyes as well as in vitro intracellular dye injections. Our results indicate that corticotectal and corticopontine neurons are located predominantly in the upper middle part of layer V. These neurons have medium to large somas with 5 or 6 primary basal dendrites and a single apical dendrite ascending to layer I. Approximately 60% of these cells send axon collaterals to both the superior colliculus and the pons. In contrast, callosal neurons form a heterogeneous group. In general, they have small pyramidal or ovoid cell bodies which give rise to 3 or 4 primary basal dendrites. Many cells have an apical dendrite that bifurcates and terminates in layer V or IV. We find that callosal neurons do not send an axon collateral to either the superior colliculus or the pons. We conclude that the corticotectal and corticopontine systems are similar in their intralaminar distribution, dendritic morphology, and pattern of axon collaterals, whereas the callosal system differs in these characteristics."

        ], 
        "abstract": [
            "The relationship between pyramidal cell morphology and efferent target was investigated in layer 6 of cat primary visual cortex (area 17). Layer 6 has 2 projections, one to the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) and another to the visual claustrum. The cells of origin of each projection were identified by retrograde transport of fluorescent latex microspheres. The labeled cells were visualized in brain slices prepared from area 17, using an epifluorescence compound microscope modified for intracellular recording. Individual retrogradely labeled cells were penetrated and intracellularly stained with Lucifer yellow to visualize the patterns of axons and dendrites associated with each projection. The neurons that give rise to the 2 projections had very different patterns of dendrites and local axonal collaterals, but the patterns within each group were highly stereotyped. The differences between their axonal collaterals were particularly dramatic. Claustrum projecting cells had fine, horizontally directed collaterals that arborized exclusively in layer 6 and lower layer 5. Most LGN projecting cells had virtually no horizontal arborization in layer 6. Instead, they sent widespread collaterals vertically, which arborized extensively in layer 4. The apical dendrites of the 2 groups also differed markedly. Claustrum projecting cells had apical dendrites reaching to layer 1, with branches in layer 5 only, while LGN projecting cells never had an apical dendrite reaching higher than layer 3, with side branches in layers 5 and 4. Therefore, each efferent target must receive inputs from neurons whose synaptic connections within area 17 are significantly different from those of neurons projecting to other targets. This further suggests that distinct visual response properties should be associated with each projection. In addition to the claustrum and LGN projecting cells, about 20% of layer 6 pyramidal neurons lacked an efferent axon. Morphologically, most resembled LGN projecting neurons, but a few had characteristics of claustrum projecting cells. These neurons may represent cells that either failed to make an efferent connection or cells that lost an efferent axon during development. Their frequency suggests that such intrinsic, presumably excitatory, neurons may play a significant role in cortical processing."

(i) One class consists of inputs from thalamic relay nuclei for vision, audition, and somesthesis to layer IV, layer III, or both. In contrast, autoradiographic studies of projections from other thalamic nuclei reveal strikingly different patterns of termination: (ii) layer VI (or layer V, or both) is the target of fibers from the intralaminar nuclei, and (iii) layer I is the target for fibers from the ventromedial and magnocellular medial geniculate nuclei. (iv) The remaining class is typified by termination both in layer I and in additional layers that depend on the cortical area in which the terminations are found. The data demonstrate that convergent thalamic inputs to a given cortical area are usually not confluent within a layer and provide a new frame-work for categorizing thalamic nuclei."

            "Pyramidal neurons in layers V and VI of cat primary auditory cortex (AI) were intracellularly injected with biocytin after functional characterization according to a position relative to an anteroposterior sequence of best-frequency responses. A sample of 19 completely filled neurons was analyzed, and a preliminary classification was made on the basis of dendritic morphology and axon collateral distribution. Layer V cells could be divided into two types. Cells in the upper part of layer V and projecting toward the diencephalon had a large cell body and an apical dendrite with extensive branches in layer I. These cells had few recurrent axon collaterals, and no terminal axonal bushes were formed in the vicinity of the dendritic field. Long horizontal collaterals with many boutons, however, extended in various directions parallel to the cortical surface. By contrast, cells in the lower part of layer V and sending an axon into the putamen, or without an obvious subcortical axon, had a medium soma and an apical dendrite with few branches in layer I. These cells had a dense bush of recurrent collaterals extending into layers II and III and surrounding the dendritic field, but few or no horizontal collaterals. Layer VI injected neurons were more heterogeneous. All had a thin ascending dendrite with oblique branches both ending in layer III. Axon collateral distributions varied from cell to cell. Relatively small cells with an apical dendrite that branched frequently in layers III and IV had a dense network of recurrent collaterals in the dendritic field, but virtually no horizontal collaterals. This type projected toward the diencephalon. Cells with relatively long horizontal collaterals and a weak recurrent system confined to layers V and VI had a unique arborization pattern of basal dendrites. This type may have projected to the claustrum or other cortical areas. One cell with dendritic branches restricted to layer VI had horizontal collaterals predominantly in layer VI. This cell projected into the corpus callosum. The apparent close correlation between extrinsic projections of infragranular neurons and their dendritic morphology and intracortical collateral distributions suggests that differentially projecting cells may engage different elements of intracortical circuitry in AI."

        "abstract": [
            "1. Pyramidal neurones in the precentral motor area of the monkey were studied using intracellular techniques. Pyramidal tract neurones (PTNs) were identified by antidromic activation from the cerebral peduncles or medullary pyramids. Orthodromic responses were recorded in PTNs and in other pyramidal neurones when antidromic volleys were set up by stimulation of the peduncles or pyramids. The neurones were then labelled by intracellular ionophoresis of horseradish peroxidase and their morphology examined. All neurones studied were identified as pyramidal cells according to their morphology. 2. Six pyramidal neurones located in lamina V were well stained; they included two fast PTNs and two slow PTNs. The morphology of all pyramidal neurones in this lamina (fast PTNs, slow PTNs and those pyramidal cells that were not antidromically characterized) was essentially similar. A single apical dendrite branched as it ascended and its terminals arborized subpially. Numerous lateral and oblique dendrites branched from the apical dendrites in lamina V and near its border with lamina III: short basal dendrites arborized in the vicinity of the soma in lamina V. Long basal dendrites had a wider field of arborization in lamina V and sometimes extended into lamina VI. 3. Three to five collaterals arose from the axon of lamina V cells in the cortex and arborized in laminae V and VI. Short collateral branches arborized in the vicinity of the soma in the region of the basal and lateral dendrites. Long collateral branches could be traced over long distances (often more than 1 mm). One pyramidal neurone in this lamina (a fast PTN) lacked short collateral branches from the axon. 4. Four pyramidal neurones in lamina III were stained well. The dendritic morphology of all these neurones was similar. Apical dendrites branched as they ascended and terminated subpially. Lateral and basal dendrites formed a column of dendritic branches around the soma. No long basal dendrites were seen. 5. The number and arborization of intracortical collaterals from the axon of lamina III cells varied widely; from three to twelve collaterals arose from the axon. The biggest arbor of collateral branches involved all the cortical laminae and was about 3 mm wide mediolaterally, while the smallest arbor was restricted mainly to lamina III in the vicinity of the soma. One neurone in this lamina also lacked short collateral branches from the axon. 6. Antidromic volleys from the pyramidal tract evoked excitatory responses in fast PTNs, predominantly inhibitory responses in slow PTNs and either excitatory or inhibitory responses in other pyramidal neurones in lamina V.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"

        "abstract": [
            "The understanding of any neural circuit requires the identification and characterization of all its components. Morphologic classifications of neurons are, therefore, of central importance to neuroscience. We use a quantitative method to classify neurons from layer 5 of mouse primary visual cortex, based on multidimensional clustering. To reconstruct neurons, we used Golgi impregnations and biocytin injections, as well as DiOlistics, a novel technique of labeling neurons with lipophilic dyes. We performed computerized 3-D reconstructions of 158 layer 5 cells to measure a series of morphologic variables. Principal component analysis and cluster analysis were used for the classification of cell types. Five major classes of cells were found: group 1 includes large pyramidal neurons with apical dendrites that reach layer 1 with an apical tuft; group 2 consists of short pyramidal neurons and large multipolar cells with \"polarized\" dendritic trees; group 3 is composed of less extensive pyramidal neurons; group 4 includes small cells; and group 5 includes another set of short pyramidal neurons in addition to \"atypically oriented\" cells. Our sample included a relatively homogeneous group of 27 neurons that project to the superior colliculus, which clustered mainly in group 1, thus supporting the validity of the classification. Cluster analysis of neuronal morphologies provides an objective method to quantitatively define different neuronal phenotypes and may serve as a basis for describing neocortical circuits."

            "High-frequency synchronous activity of neurons in the cerebral cortex and thalamus is a concomitant of discrete conscious events. In the primate thalamus, a newly identified population of neurons provides a basis for this synchronization. A matrix of calbindin-immunoreactive neurons extends throughout the thalamus and projects to superficial layers of cortex over wide areas, unconstrained by boundaries between areas. In some nuclei, a core of parvalbumin-immunoreactive neurons is superimposed upon the matrix. Core neurons project in a topographically ordered fashion to middle layers of the cortex in an area-specific manner. Matrix neurons, recruited by corticothalamic connections, can disperse activity across cortical areas and thalamic nuclei. Their superficial terminations can synchronize specific and nonspecific elements of the thalamocortical network in coherent activity that underlies cognitive events."

        ], 
        "abstract": [
            "The frontal lobe projections of the mediodorsal (MD) nucleus of the thalamus were examined in rhesus monkey by transport of retrograde markers injected into one of nine cytoarchitectonic regions (Walker's areas 6, 8A, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 46, and Brodmann's area 4) located in the rostral third of the cerebrum. Each area of prefrontal, premotor, or motor cortex injected was found to receive a topographically unique thalamic input from clusters of cells in specific subdivisions within MD. All of the prefrontal areas examined also receive topographically organized inputs from other thalamic nuclei including, most prominently, the ventral anterior (VA) and medial pulvinar nuclei. Conversely, and in agreement with previous findings, MD projects to areas of the frontal lobe beyond the traditional borders of prefrontal cortex, such as the anterior cingulate and supplementary motor cortex. The topography of thalamocortical neurons revealed in coronal sections through VA, MD, and pulvinar is circumferential. In the medial part of MD, for example, thalamocortical neurons shift from a dorsal to a ventral position for cortical targets lying medial to lateral along the ventral surface of the lobe; neurons in the lateral MD move from a ventral to a dorsal position, for cortical areas situated lateral to medial on the convexity of the hemisphere. The aggregate evidence for topographic specificity is supported further by experiments in which different fluorescent dyes were placed in multiple areas of the frontal lobe in each of three cases. The results show that very few, if any, thalamic neurons project to more than one area of cortex. The widespread cortical targets of MD neurons together with evidence for multiple thalamic inputs to prefrontal areas support a revision of the classical hodological definition of prefrontal cortex as the exclusive cortical recipient of MD projections. Rather, the prefrontal cortex is defined by multiple specific relationships with the thalamus."

            "We investigated the axonal morphology of single corticothalamic (CT) neurons of the motor cortex (Mx) in the cat thalamus, using a neuronal tracer, biotinylated dextran amine (BDA). After localized injection of BDA into the Mx, labeled CT axons were found ipsilaterally in the thalamic reticular nucleus (TRN), the ventroanterior-ventrolateral complex (VA-VL), the central lateral nucleus (CL), the central medial nucleus, and the centromedian nucleus, but with the primary focus in the VA-VL. The terminals in the VA-VL formed a large laminar cluster, which extended approximately in parallel with the internal medullary lamina. The laminar organization mirrored morphologic features of single CT axons. We reconstructed the trajectories of 25 single CT axons that arose from layer V (16 axons) or layer VI (9 axons) and terminated in the VA-VL. Terminals of single CT axons that originated from both layer V and layer VI were confined within a laminar structure about 700 microm thick, suggesting the existence of laminar input organization in the VA-VL. Otherwise, the two groups of the CT axons showed contrasting features. All of the CT axons derived from layer VI gave rise to a few short collaterals to the TRN and then formed extensive arborization with numerous small, drumstick-like terminals in the VA-VL. On the other hand, the CT axons arising from layer V gave rise to collaterals whose main axons descended into the cerebral peduncle. Each collateral projected to the VA-VL or CL without projection to the TRN and formed a few small clusters of giant terminals. The two groups of CT neurons in the same cortical column had convergent rather than segregated termination in the VA-VL. However, the terminals of layer VI CT neurons were distributed diffusely and widely in the VA-VL, whereas the terminals of layer V CT neurons were much more focused and surrounded by the terminals of the former group. These contrasting features of the two types of CT projections appear to represent their different functional roles in the generation of motor commands and control of movements in the Mx."

        ], 
        "abstract": [
            "The lateral posterior (LP) nucleus is a higher order thalamic nucleus that is believed to play a key role in the transmission of visual information between cortical areas. Two types of cortical terminals have been identified in higher order nuclei, large (type II) and smaller (type I), which have been proposed to drive and modulate, respectively, the response properties of thalamic cells (Sherman and Guillery [1998] Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 95:7121-7126). The aim of this study was to assess and compare the relative contribution of driver and modulator inputs to the LP nucleus that originate from the posteromedial part of the lateral suprasylvian cortex (PMLS) and area 17. To achieve this goal, the anterograde tracers biotinylated dextran amine (BDA) or Phaseolus vulgaris leucoagglutinin (PHAL) were injected into area 17 or PMLS. Results indicate that area 17 injections preferentially labelled large terminals, whereas PMLS injections preferentially labelled small terminals. A detailed analysis of PMLS terminal morphology revealed at least four categories of terminals: small type I terminals (57%), medium-sized to large singletons (30%), large terminals in arrangements of intermediate complexity (8%), and large terminals that form arrangements resembling rosettes (5%). Ultrastructural analysis and postembedding immunocytochemical staining for gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) distinguished two types of labelled PMLS terminals: small profiles with round vesicles (RS profiles) that contacted mostly non-GABAergic dendrites outside of glomeruli and large profiles with round vesicles (RL profiles) that contacted non-GABAergic dendrites (55%) and GABAergic dendritic terminals (45%) in glomeruli. RL profiles likely include singleton, intermediate, and rosette terminals, although future studies are needed to establish definitively the relationship between light microscopic morphology and ultrastructural features. All terminals types appeared to be involved in reciprocal corticothalamocortical connections as a result of an intermingling of terminals labelled by anterograde transport and cells labelled by retrograde transport. In conclusion, our results indicate that the origin of the driver inputs reaching the LP nucleus is not restricted to the primary visual cortex and that extrastriate visual areas might also contribute to the basic organization of visual receptive fields of neurons in this higher order nucleus."

        "abstract": [
            "The organization of the prefrontocaudate connection in the macaque monkey was studied with a polyacrylamide gel of horseradish peroxidase that was injected, after callosotomy, into the head of the caudate nucleus. Tissues were processed for peroxidase activity with tetramethylbenzidine. Retrogradely labeled cells appeared bilaterally in the prefrontal cortex, and ipsilaterally in the premotor area, frontal operculum, insula, and rostral region of the temporal cortex. In the prefrontal cortex, labeled cells were located in cortical layers 2-6. In layer 2, labeled cells were occasionally seen. In layer 3, a considerable number of labeled cells were seen and were mainly distributed in its lower part. They were pyramidal cells. Layer 4 contained a considerable number of labeled cells that were pyramidal or round. Somal sizes of these labeled cells were from 5 to 15 micron, but none of the cells less than 5 micron were labeled. Layer 5 was densely packed with labeled cells, though at a higher density in its upper part (5a). They were pyramidal cells. In layer 6, pyramidal or fusiform cells were labeled at a lower density than in layer 5. The laminar pattern and density of labeled cells were different among various regions of the prefrontal cortex, but, in general, the supragranular labeling tended to frequently occur in the regions containing the numerous labeled cells. There was a topographical relationship between the prefrontal regions containing the majority of labeled cells and the injection sites in the head of the caudate nucleus: the medial orbitofrontal cortex and the medial surface extending downward from the rostral sulcus project ipsilaterally to the medialmost portion of the ventromedial part of the head of the nucleus, the lateral orbitofrontal cortex projects to the ventromedial part of the head of the nucleus, and the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex ventral to the principal sulcus projects to the central part of the head of the nucleus. Our findings in the macaque monkey indicate that the corticocaudate connection is similar in laminar organization of efferent neurons to the corticocortical connections."

            "The axonal projections from the centre median (CM)/parafascicular (Pf) thalamic complex in squirrel monkeys were studied after microiontophoretic injections of biotinylated dextran amine under electrophysiological guidance. A total of 29 axons connected to their parent cell body were entirely reconstructed from serial sections with a camera lucida. Our investigation shows that the CM and Pf nuclei in primates comprise three types of projection neurons: (1) neurons that innervate densely and focally the striatum; (2) neurons that arborize diffusely in the cerebral cortex; and (3) neurons that innervate both striatum and cerebral cortex. Striatal innervation of CM origin consists of dense clusters of axon terminals exhibiting pedunculated varicosities and forming oblique bands in the dorsolateral sector of putamen (sensorimotor striatal territory). The same type of striatal innervation occurs in the head of caudate nucleus (associative striatal territory) in cases of Pf-labeled neurons. The CM neurons that target cerebral cortex arborize principally in motor and premotor areas, whereas Pf neurons innervate chiefly prefrontal areas. Cortical innervation from both nuclei is much more profuse in layers V and VI than in layer I. Our three-dimensional reconstruction studies show that dendritic and axonal arborizations of CM neurons extend essentially along the sagittal plane. These results revealed that, in contrast to rodents where virtually all Pf neurons project to both striatum and cortex, the primate CM/Pf complex harbors several types of highly patterned projection neurons. As such, this complex might be considered as an integral part of the widely distributed basal ganglia neuronal system."

        "abstract": [
            "The pulvinar nucleus is a major source of input to visual cortical areas, but many important facts are still unknown concerning the organization of pulvinocortical (PC) connections and their possible interactions with other connectional systems. In order to address some of these questions, we labeled PC connections by extracellular injections of biotinylated dextran amine into the lateral pulvinar of two monkeys, and analyzed 25 individual axons in several extrastriate areas by serial section reconstruction. This approach yielded four results: (1) in all extrastriate areas examined (V2, V3, V4, and middle temporal area [MT]/V5), PC axons consistently have 2-6 multiple, spatially distributed arbors; (2) in each area, there is a small number of larger caliber axons, possibly originating from a subpopulation of calbindin-positive giant projection neurons in the pulvinar; (3) as previously reported by others, most terminations in extrastriate areas are concentrated in layer 3, but they can occur in other layers (layers 4,5,6, and, occasionally, layer 1) as collaterals of a single axon; in addition, (4) the size of individual arbors and of the terminal field as a whole varies with cortical area. In areas V2 and V3, there is typically a single principal arbor (0.25-0.50 mm in diameter) and several smaller arbors. In area V4, the principal arbor is larger (2.0- to 2.5-mm-wide), but in area MT/V5, the arbors tend to be smaller (0.15 mm in diameter). Size differences might result from specializations of the target areas, or may be more related to the particular injection site and how this projects to individual cortical areas. Feedforward cortical axons, except in area V2, have multiple arbors, but these do not show any obvious size progression. Thus, in areas V2, V3, and especially V4, PC fields are larger than those of cortical axons, but in MT/V5 they are smaller. Terminal specializations of PC connections tend to be larger than those of corticocortical, but the projection foci are less dense. Further work is necessary to determine the differential interactions within and between systems, and how these might result in the complex patterns of suppression and enhancement, postulated as gating mechanisms in cortical attentional effects, or in different states of arousal."

        ], 
        "abstract": [
            "This study examines the organization of thalamostriatal projections from ventral tier nuclei that relay basal ganglia output to the frontal cortex. Although previous thalamostriatal studies emphasize projections from the intralaminar nuclei, studies in primates show a substantial projection from the ventral anterior (VA) and ventral lateral (VL) nuclei. These nuclei make up the main efferent projection from the basal ganglia to frontal cortical areas, including primary motor, supplementary, premotor, and cingulate motor areas. Functionally related motor areas of the frontal cortex and VA/VL have convergent projections to specific regions of the dorsal striatum. The distribution of VA/VL terminals within the striatum is crucial to understanding their relationship to motor cortical afferents. We placed anterograde tracer injections into discrete VA/VL thalamic areas. VA/VL thalamostriatal projections terminate in broad, rostrocaudal regions of the dorsal striatum, corresponding to regions innervated by functionally related cortical motor areas. The pars oralis division of VL projects primarily to the dorsolateral, postcommissural putamen, whereas the parvicellular VA targets more medial and rostral putamen regions, and the magnocellular division of VA targets the dorsal head of the caudate nucleus. Whereas these results demonstrate a general functional topography, specific VA/VL projections overlap extensively, suggesting that functionally distinct VA/VL projections may also converge in dorsal striatal areas. Within striatal territories, VA/VL projections terminate in a patchy, nonhomogeneous manner, indicating another level of complexity. Moreover, terminal fields contain both terminal clusters and scattered, long, unbranched fibers with many varicosities. These fiber morphologies resemble those from the cortex and raise the possibility that VA/VL thalamostriatal projections neurons have divergent connectional features."

        "abstract": [
            "Six injections (approximately 1 mm in diameter) of biotinylated dextran amine (BDA) were placed in different locations of the primary motor cortex of the rhesus monkey. Anterograde and retrograde labeling patterns in the thalamus were charted and individual labeled axons traced in continuous serial sections. Both anterograde and retrograde labeling in the thalamus was extensive, spanning several millimeters mediolaterally and including ventral lateral, ventral anterior, centromedian, and centrolateral nuclei. Paracentral, mediodorsal, lateral posterior, and medial pulvinar nuclei were also labeled. Two basic types of corticothalamic axons were identified: small to medium-width, type 1 axons that formed large terminal fields with small boutons, and thick, type 2 axons that formed small terminal fields with large boutons. Within each group, subtypes were identified based on specific features of the axons and terminals: two subtypes of type 1 axons and four subtypes of type 2 axons. The results revealed multiple modes of corticothalamic connectivity: sparsely distributed type 1 axons, dense plexuses of type 1 axons, type 2 axon terminal fields either singly or in clusters, and mixed plexuses of type 1 and type 2 axons. Only some cells in the plexuses were retrogradely labeled; some plexuses did not contain any labeled neurons, and many retrogradely labeled neurons were in the regions devoid of anterograde labeling. These connectivity patterns differed between thalamic nuclei. The results revealed much more complex relationships between M1 and thalamus than were previously thought to exist. It is suggested that this connectivity is neither of exclusively a feedback nature nor perfectly reciprocal but is subserved by a multitude of channels, most likely originating from different populations of cortical neurons, and feeding into a variety of functionally different neuronal networks, with each processing specific information."

            "We have analyzed the parafascicular thalamic projection to extrastriatal structures of the basal ganglia using anterograde and retrograde tracing in monkeys. We identified (1) retrogradely labeled neurons in the parafascicular nucleus projecting to the anteromedial, limbic part of the external and internal pallidum, the substantia nigra and the subthalamic nucleus, (2) labeled terminals scattered in all these structures after anterograde tracer injection into the medial part of the parafascicular nucleus and (3) individual parafascicular terminals that arborized rather poorly in a large portion of each basal ganglia structure. Our study provides evidence that the parafascicular nucleus, and especially its medial part, can relay emotional and motivational information back to all basal ganglia components in primates."

            "Corticostriatal and corticothalamic projections arising from the second somatosensory area in the rat were studied after labeling small pools of neurons in laminae V and VI with biocytin. Tracing the axon of single neurons revealed the following principles of organization: (i) all corticostriatal and corticothalamic projections arising from layer V cells are collaterals of long-range corticofugal axons that also project below the thalamic level; (ii) all layer V cells that project to the thalamus also project to the striatum; (iii) all layer VI corticothalamic cells project exclusively to the thalamus; (iv) cells of the upper part of lamina VI send collaterals to the thalamic reticular nucleus and arborize in the ventrobasal complex forming rod-like terminal fields; and (v) cells of the lower part of lamina VI also send collaterals to the thalamic reticular nucleus, give off few branches in the ventrobasal complex and terminate principally in the caudal part of the posterior thalamic group. On the basis of these findings, and in the light of previous anatomical studies, it is proposed that the above mentioned organizing principles represent general rules that also apply to corticostriatal and corticothalamic pathways arising from other areas of the neocortex."

            "The current model of basal ganglia rests on the idea that the striatofugal system is composed of two separate (direct and indirect) pathways originating from distinct cell populations in the striatum. The striatum itself is divided into two major compartments, the striosomes and the matrix, which differ by their neurochemical makeup and input/output connections. Here, neurons located in either striosomes or the extrastriosomal matrix in squirrel monkeys were injected with biotin dextran amine, and their labeled axons were entirely reconstructed with a camera lucida. Twenty-four of 27 reconstructed axons arborized into the three main striatal targets (external pallidum, globus pallidus, and substantia nigra pars reticulata), a finding that is at odds with the concept of a dual striatofugal system. Axons of striosomal neurons formed several columnar terminal fields in the substantia nigra pars reticulata. These data indicate that the substantia nigra pars compacta is neither the only nor the main target of striosomal neurons, a finding that calls for a reevaluation of the organization of the striatonigral projection system."

        ], 
        "abstract": [
            "This paper addresses the question of a general topological principle of thalamo-cortical projections. In the lissencephalic primate brain of the common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus), large injections of horseradish peroxidase were made in various parts of the neocortex. These injections were placed in different animals and hemispheres along various caudo-rostral and medio-lateral gradients. Labelled cells in the thalamus were plotted and the labelling-zones resulting from several injections along a medio-lateral and two caudo-rostral cortical vectors were drawn into semi-schematic thalamic maps. These composite maps reveal a topological organization of the whole thalamo-cortical projection. The thalamic representation of the caudo-rostral and medio-lateral gradients indicate a rotation of the posterior relative to the anterior thalamus. An attempt is made to relate the organization of the thalamo-cortical projection to the development of the thalamus and the cortex. The cortex is divided into concentric zones around the sensory-motor and insular cortex. The thalamus is divided into corresponding projection zones. The topology of thalamo-cortical connections can then be regarded as a consequence of corresponding thalamic and cortical growth gradients. This is not only consistent with the general thalamo-cortical topology and the inversion of maps from thalamus to cortex, but also explains the continuity and overlap of thalamic projection zones in the pulvinar to widely separated cortical areas as the parietal, temporal and frontal association cortex."

            "The general topographical organization of the thalamo-cortical projection of two rodents, the Siberian hamster (Phodopus sungorus) and the Guinea pig (Cavia aperta) was investigated with the HRP-method and compared with that of the new world primate marmoset (Cal-lithrix jacchus) as shown in a companion study by Brysch et al. (1990). HRP was injected into various regions of the cortex in different animals and hemispheres, and plots were made of the retrogradely stained thalamic projection neurons. The thalamocortical projection is virtually identical in both rodent species. It is topological throughout in that nearby cortical injections label nearby, though overlapping cell groups in the thalamus. Cortical injections in a rostro-caudal progression labelled thalamic projection zones on top of each other, layered like tiles on a roof or fish scales, beginning in the rostromedial and ending in the caudo-dorsal thalamus. The progression vector of thalamic zones projecting successively from more rostral to more caudal cortical zones is twisted and turns from a predominantly mediolateral direction in the anterior thalamus to an essentially ventro-dorsal direction in the posterior thalamus In the marmoset, the thalamo-cortical topography follows the same topological rule, with the exception of the lateral geniculate body which is translocated latero-ventrally and separated from the rest of the thalamus as in all primates. This suggests a general thalamo-cortical mapping rule common to all mammals which can be related to gradients and timing of cell birth in the thalamus. It is proposed that this mapping rule is the consequence of successive appositions of neurons in the medio-ventral thalamus during ontogenetic development."

        ], 
        "abstract": [
            "The thalamic relations of the caudal inferior parietal lobule and the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex in monkeys have been investigated with both anterograde and retrograde neuroanatomical tracing techniques. The results of these experiments indicate that the medial pulvinar nucleus (Pul.m.) is the principal thalamic relay to the gyral surface of the caudal inferior parietal lobule (area 7a). Within the Pul.m. there are two or three disklike aggregates of neurons which project to area 7a; these disklike neuronal aggregates are oriented from dorsomedial to ventrolateral and extend over most of the rostrocaudal extent of the nucleus. Within these disks there are rodlike clusters of neurons which are elongated in the rostrocaudal dimension of the thalamus, and which project in a topographically ordered manner to area 7a. Thus, the more rostrally located neurons within the Pul.m. disks project to more rostral parts of area 7a and, conversely, the more caudally located neurons project to the caudal part of this cortical field. Similarly, the medial part of each disk projects to the lateral part of area 7a while the laterally placed neurons project to the medial part of the cortical field. In addition to its input from the Pul.m., area 7a is also reciprocally connected with the magnocellular division of the nucleus ventralis anterior, with the nuclei which abut upon the medullary capsule of the laterodorsal nucleus, and with the suprageniculate nucleus and the nucleus limitans. The cortex on the lateral bank of the intraparietal sulcus (the so-called lateral intraparietal area, LIP) projects principally to the lateral pulvinar nucleus (Pul.l) of the thalamus rather than to Pul.m. Area LIP has been found to project to the pregeniculate nucleus, the zona incerta, the anterior pretectal nucleus, and the superior colliculus. Area 7a projects to none of these structures, but it does project to the posterior pretectal nucleus. The thalamic relations of the neighboring cortical regions, such as the prelunate gyrus and area 7b, are also distinct from those of area 7a. It thus seems that the prelunate gyrus is primarily interconnected with the Pul.l., and area 7b with the oral pulvinar nucleus. Taken together these different subcortical relationships provide further evidence for the view that the caudal inferior parietal lobule is not a homogeneous cortical area, but is composed of a number of subsidiary fields. The projection from the Pul.m. to the lateral prefrontal cortex arises from disklike aggregates of neurons, similar in their orientation to the neuronal disks that project to area 7a.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"

            "Using autoradiography and the horseradish peroxidase method, the morphology and laminar distribution of cortico-pulvinar neurons and the reciprocity of connections between pulvinar and cortex were examined in five Rhesus monkeys which had received medial, lateral and inferior pulvinar nucleus injections of both tritiated amino acids and horseradish peroxidase. Cortico-pulvinar neurons were identified in one heterotypical cortical area (area 17) and in many homotypical areas in frontal (areas 45, 46, 11, 12), parietal (5, 7), occipital (18, 19) and temporal (20, 21, 22) lobes. The cortico-pulvinar neurons were pyramidal in shape and ranged in size from small to large. In heterotypical cortex they were found in layers V and VI whereas in area 17 they were found only in layer Vb. Reciprocal connections between pulvinar and cortex were a feature of homotypical but not heterotypical cortex."

            "The areal and laminar distribution of the cortical efferents of the medial, lateral and inferior pulvinar nuclei (PM, PL and PI respectively) were determined in rhesus monkey using autoradiography and Horseradish Peroxidase (HRP). The autoradiographic data indicated that: areas 8a, 45 and 46 on the convexity and 11 and 12 on the orbital surface of the frontal lobe received projections from PM; areas 20, 21 and 22 in temporal lobe received projections from PM primarily with caudal-medial parts of PM projecting to more rostral-dorsal parts of temporal lobe and rostral-lateral parts of PM projecting to more caudal-ventral parts of temporal lobe but PL also sends some efferents to caudal temporal lobe; areas 5 and 7 in parietal lobe and 18 and 19 in occipital lobe received projections primarily from the region in pulvinar comprising PL and PI with the more ventral parts of this region porsal parts of this region projecting to the more dorsal-lateral and medial parts of parieto-occipital cortex and with PM comtributing slightly to these projections rostrally. The autoradiographic information on the pulvinar projections to frontal lobe and temporal pole was supplemented by data derived from cortical HRP injections. These indicated that although only PM of the pulvinar subnuclei projected to these regions, three other caudal thalamic structures, i.e., medial dorsal nucleus, nucleus limitans and suprageniculate nucleus also projected to these regions raising some questions about the identity of the densocellular part of the medial dorsal nucleus which has also been considered to be part of pulvinar. The laminar distribution of pulvinar cortical efferents was uniformly similar regardless of the pulvinar recipient area examined. Elevated numbers of silver grains were observed over all cortical layers, but the silver grains were densest over the deep parts of layer III. The thalamic reticular nucleus was the only diencephalic structure observed to receive projections from pulvinar and it did so from PM, PL and PI. The pulvinar's efferents are to homotypical rather than heterotypical cortex and its connections are most extensive with cortex rather than with subcortical structures."

        ], 
        "abstract": [
            "The retrograde transport of horseradish peroxidase has been used to identify efferent cells in area 17 of the macaque. Cells projecting to the lateral geniculate nucleus are small to medium sized pyramidal neurons with somata in lamina 6 and the adjacent white matter. The projection to the parvocellular division arises preferentially from the upper half of lamina 6, while that to the magnocellular division arises preferentially from the lower part of the lamina. The projection to both superior colliculus and inferior pulvinar arises from all sizes of pyramidal neurons lying in lamina 58 (Lund and Boothe, '75); at least pyramidal neurons of lamina 5B send collateral axon branches to both destinations. Injections with extensive spread of horseradish peroxidase show that many cells of lamina 4B and the large pyramidal neurons of upper lamina 6 also project extrinsically but their terminal sites have not been identified. Other studies have indicated that cells of laminae 2 and 3 project to areas 18 and 19. Therefore every lamina of the visual cortex, with the exception of those receiving a direct thalamic input, contains cells projecting extrinsically. Further, each lamina projects to a different destination and from Golgi studies can be shown to contain cells with specific patterns of dendritic branching which relate to the distribution of thalamic afferents and to the patterns of intracortical connections. These findings emphasise the significance of the horizontal organisation of the cortex with relation to the flow of information through it and contrast with the current concept of columnar organisation shown in physiological studies."

        ], 
        "abstract": [
            "A cytoarchitectonic parcellation has been made of the cortex of the insula and of the adjoining parts of the temporal and parietal lobes in rhesus and squirrel monkeys. In conjunction with this, the intracortical distribution of the thalamo-cortical fibers has been studied by the autoradiographic tracing technique. There is a systematic change in the density, laminar distribution and general character of the intracortical thalamic afferent plexus which seems to follow, in particular, the progressive differentiation of cortical layering that occurs in moving from insular through granular to homotypical cortex. In the dysgranular and granular insular areas in which cortical lamination is indistinct, the thalamic plexus as demonstrated autoradiographically is sparse and extends through much of layers III and IV. In the granular cortex (areas 3b and AI), the thalamic plexus is densest and coarsest; it fills all of layers IV and IIIB and extends into layer IIIA. In the \"second\" and \"third\" sensory areas, such as the second somatic sensory and many of the auditory fields, the density of the plexus and its coarseness diminish slightly and the deeper half of layer IV becomes free of terminals. In the homotypical cortex, the plexus becomes sparser, finer and strictly confined to layer IIIB. In many areas there are additional indications of thalamic terminations in deeper layers. Where layers V and VI are not divided into sublaminae (e.g.,in areas 3b and AI) there is labeling of the superficial half of layer VI. Where layers V and VI become subdivided in the homotypical cortex, the auditory and adjacent fields were only observed in cases in which the magnocellular nucleus of the medial geniculate body was involved by the injection of isotope. The boundaries of the cortical projection fields of individual thalamic nuclei, as determined autoradiographically, are remarkably sharp and invariably coincide with a sharp architectonic boundary or with a zone of maximal cytoarchitectonic change. Zones of apparent architectonic transition never showed overlap of thalamic afferents emanating from more than one nucleus. These results raise for discussion the significance of architectonic structure in relation to cortical connectivity and have a bearing upon those studies that have attempted to relate the terminals of thalamic afferents to particular classes of cortical neuron."

            "The patterns of arborisation of apical dendrites of different varieties of pyramidal neurons in area 17 differ and are characteristic for each cell type. They appear to serve as a means of collating within one neuron information derived directly from several different laminae. These different patterns of apical dendrite arborisation provide dendritic links which relate closely to the laminar distribution of axons of the spiny stellate neurons as well as the pyramidal neurons themselves. The axons of spiny stellate neurons lying in laminae IVC and IVA (Lund, '73) - Which receive information from parvocellular geniculate layers  -  project heavily to the lower half of lamina III (IIIB) and to a narrow zone at the top of lamina V (VA); laminae IIIB and VA are in turn linked by a specific variety of pyramidal neuron, with basal dendritic field in lamina VI, whose apical dendrite has marked lateral branching only in laminae VA and IIIB (where it terminates). Pyramidal neurons with basal dendritic field in laminae VA (with vestigial apical dendrite) or in IIIB have recurrent axon projections to lamina IIIA and above (the descending axon projection of lamina IIIB pyramids is principally to lamina VA itself). The pyramidal neurons of laminae IIIA and above have axons which distribute in the same upper laminae as their dendtritic fields and a descending axon projection to lamina VB. Pyramidal neurons with basal dendritic field on lamina VB have an apical dendrite which, if not vestigal, arborises in IIIA or above; their axons in some cases project to the superior colliculus or may be exclusively, or in addition, recurrent, distributing collaterals within laminae VB, VI and in IIIA or above; one variety of pyramidal neuron with basal dentritic field in lamina VI makes a dentritic link with these same regions, its apical dendrite arborising first within lamina VB and then in lamina IIIA and above. \rAxons of spiny stellate neurons of lamina IVC (which receives the projection of the magnocellular layers of the lateral geniculate nucleus) as well as distributing widely within lamina IVC also contribute to laminae IVB and VA; a link is again made by a specific variety of pyramidal neuron, with basal dendtritic field in lamina VI, which shows branching to its apical dendtrite only in laminae VA and as a terminal arborisation in IVC. Another variety of pyramidal neuron with basal dendtric field in lamina VI has apical dendritic arborisation only in lamina IVB. The pyramidal neurons with basal dendritic field in lamina IVB and apical dendrite arborising in lamina IIIB and above, also contribute axonal collatetrals to lamina IIIA and above; their horizontal axon collaterals, together with the axons of spiny stellate neurons of laminae IVC and IVB, form the horizontal fiber band of lamina IVB (to which the axons of laminae III and II pyramidal neurons do not contribute. The descending axon projection of the spiny stellate and pyramidal neurons of lamina IVB appears to be principally to lamina VI. \rThe pattern of branching of pyramidal neuron apical dendrites is therefore neither random nor a continuum of one basic pattern; instead it is a series of separate patterns, each spatially distributed in a highly specific and unique fashion relating to the patterns of projection of afferent information through the cortex.

        ], 
        "abstract": [
            "BACKGROUND: The neocortical commissures have a fundamental role in functional integration across the cerebral hemispheres. We investigated whether commissural projections in prefrontal cortices are organized according to the same or different rules as those within the same hemisphere, by quantitatively comparing density, topography, and laminar origin of contralateral and ipsilateral projections, labeled after unilateral injection of retrograde tracers in prefrontal areas. RESULTS: Commissural projection neurons constituted less than one third of the ipsilateral. Nevertheless, projections from the two hemispheres were strongly correlated in topography and relative density. We investigated to what extent the distribution of contralateral projections depended on: (a) geographic proximity of projection areas to the area homotopic to the injection site; (b) the structural type of the linked areas, based on the number and neuronal density of their layers. Although both measures were good predictors, structural type was a comparatively stronger determinant of the relative distribution and density of projections. Ipsilateral projection neurons were distributed in the superficial (II-III) and deep (V-VI) layers, in proportions that varied across areas. In contrast, contralateral projection neurons were found mostly in the superficial layers, but still showed a gradient in their distribution within cortical layers that correlated significantly with cortical type, but not with geographic proximity to the homotopic area. CONCLUSION: The organization of ipsilateral and contralateral prefrontal projections is similar in topography and relative density, differing only by higher overall density and more widespread laminar origin of ipsilateral than contralateral projections. The projections on both sides are highly correlated with the structural architecture of the linked areas, and their remarkable organization is likely established by punctuated development of distinct cortical types. The preponderance of contralateral projections from layer III may be traced to the late development of the callosal system, whose function may be compromised in diseases that have their root late in ontogeny."

            "The laminar pattern of axonal termination from prefrontal (caudal orbitofrontal, rostral orbitofrontal and lateral areas) to anterior temporal areas (entorhinal cortex, perirhinal cortex and area TE) and from temporal to prefrontal areas was investigated with the aid of anterograde tracers. Both regions are characterized by structural heterogeneity, and include agranular, dysgranular and granular cortical types, denoting, respectively, the absence, incipience and presence of granular layer 4. In addition, both the prefrontal and anterior temporal cortices are composed of areas that have related though specialized functions. The pattern of cortical axonal termination was associated with both the structural type of the cortex of origin and the structure of the destination cortex. Thus, efferent fibers from a single origin in either prefrontal or anterior temporal cortex terminated in different patterns depending on their target area. Conversely, axons terminated in different patterns in a single target area, prefrontal or anterior temporal, depending on their area of origin. Projections from agranular or dysgranular type cortices (e.g. medial temporal areas and caudal orbitofrontal areas) terminated mostly in the upper layers of granular cortices (e.g. area TE and lateral prefrontal areas), and projections from granular cortices terminated mostly in the deep layers of agranular or dys- granular cortices. A robust projection from dysgranular orbitofrontal areas terminated in the deep layers of the agranular entorhinal cortex. Projections from prefrontal areas to area TE terminated in the upper layers, and may facilitate focused attention on behaviorally relevant stimuli processed through reciprocal pathways between prefrontal and temporal cortices."

            "The laminar origin of cortical projections to the frontal cortex was studied in 17 adult rhesus monkeys with the use of the retrograde transport of horseradish peroxidase (HRP). The frontal regions injected with HRP extended from the posterior periarcuate region to the frontal pole. The architectonic boundaries of areas containing HRP-labeled neurons were determined from matched sections stained for the visualization of cell bodies, myelin, or acetylcholinesterase. The results showed that the laminar origin of both nearby and distant corticocortical projections was correlated with the architectonic differentiation of the regions giving rise to the projecting afferent fibers. Frontally directed projections from limbic cortices, which show a rudimentary laminar organization, emanated mainly from deep layers. On the other hand, projections from increasingly more differentiated cortices arose progressively from the upper (or supragranular) layers. This pattern was observed for projections originating along the axis of architectonic differentiation of the visual, somatosensory, auditory, motor, and prefrontal cortical systems. Thus, as the cortical architecture within each system changes from limbic areas toward the primary cortices, the origin of frontally directed projections shifts from predominantly infragranular to predominantly supragranular layers."

        ], 
        "abstract": [
            "The prefrontal cortex selects relevant signals and suppresses irrelevant signals in behavior, as exemplified by its functional interaction with superior temporal cortices. We addressed the structural basis of this process by investigating quantitatively the relationship of prefrontal pathways to inhibitory interneurons in superior temporal cortices. Pathways were labeled with neural tracers, and two neurochemical classes of inhibitory interneurons were labeled with parvalbumin (PV) and calbindin (CB), which differ in mode of inhibitory control. Both markers varied significantly and systematically across superior temporal areas. Calbindin neurons were more prevalent than PV neurons, with the highest densities found in posterior high-order auditory association cortices. Axons from anterior lateral, medial prefrontal and orbitofrontal areas terminated in the anterior half of the superior temporal gyrus, targeting mostly the superficial layers (I to upper III), where CB neurons predominated. Reciprocal projection neurons were intermingled with PV neurons, and emanated mostly from the deep part of layer III and to a lesser extent from layers V-VI, in proportions matching the laminar density of inhibitory interneurons. In marked contrast, prefrontal connections in temporal polar cortex were found mostly in the deep layers, showing mismatch with the predominant upper laminar distribution of interneurons. Differences in the relationship of connections to inhibitory neurons probably affect the dynamics in distinct superior temporal cortices. These findings may help explain the reduced efficacy of inhibitory control in superior temporal areas after prefrontal cortical damage."

        "abstract": [
            "In 25 rhesus monkeys horseradish peroxidase was injected in different parts of the frontal cortex. The retrogradely labelled thalamic neurons formed longitudinal bands, some of which crossed the internal medullary lamina, and extended from one thalamic nucleus into another. On the basis of these findings the frontal cortex was subdivided into seven transverse cortical strips which receive afferents from seven longitudinal bands of thalamic neurons. The most rostral transverse strip receives afferents from the most medial thalamic band which is oriented vertically and extends through the most medial part of the MD into the medial pulvinar. Progressively more caudally located transverse strips receive afferents from progressively more laterally located thalamic bands which in part are situated in the VL and show an increasing tilt towards the horizontal. Moreover, those parts of the various bands which are situated along the dorsal and lateral margin of the thalamus project to the medial portions of the transverse cortical strips, i.e. along the medial margin of the frontal lobe, while the other parts situated ventromedially in the thalamus project to the lateral portions of these strips, i.e. along the lateral margin of the frontal lobe. These data provide an alternative view of the organization of the thalamus and suggest that this structure contains a matrix of longitudinal cell columns which in some cases extend across specific nuclear borders and may represent the basic thalamic building blocks in respect to the thalamo-cortical connexions."

            "Golgi and axonal transport techniques have been used to examine the organization of neurons within primary visual cortex, area 17, of the cat. This organization has been compared to that of the primate cortical area 17 as described in previous studies and it is discussed in relationship to the distribution of afferents from the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus (dLGN). The visual cortex of the cat and monkey show strong similarities in the laminar positions of neurons projecting extrinsically and also in the restriction of spiny stellate neurons to a central lamina (lamina 4) receiving input from the dLGN. However, lamina 4B in the monkey, which contains spiny stellate neurons but does not receive direct input from the dLGN, has no direct counterpart in cat area 17. Axon projections of spiny stellate neurons in the other divisions of lamina 4 differ in cat and monkey: the small, closely packed neurons in the lowermost division of lamina 4 (4B in the cat, 4Cbeta in the monkey) project chiefly within lamina 4 in the cat whereas in the monkey they have a strong projection to lamina 3. In the cat, spiny stellate neurons of lamina 4A project upon lamina 3 whereas in the monkey those in the apparently equivalent zone, 4Calpha, project upon lamina 4B. Most non-spiny stellate neurons examined have precisely organized interlaminar axonal projections which differ from the axon trajectories of neighboring spiny neurons."

An important feature of the functional organization of the neostriatum has long been assumed to be the existence of a widespread lateral inhibitory network mediated by the axon collaterals of spiny projection neurons. However, these collateral connections have recently been demonstrated electrophysiologically to be relatively weak--in contrast to feedforward interneuronal inhibition, which exerts strong effects on spike timing in spiny neurons. These new data are incompatible with current \"winner-take-all\" models of lateral inhibitory function in the neostriatum, and they force a modification of established concepts of the functional roles of feedback inhibition in this nucleus."

Striatal neurons projecting either to GPi or GPe formed wide and nonoverlapping cell bands oriented obliquely and covering large portions of putamen and caudate nucleus. Subthalamic neurons projecting to GPe were more abundant and more laterally located than those projecting to GPi. A few cells branching to GPi and GPe were found in subthalamic nucleus but not in striatum. Thus, different striatal and subthalamic neuronal populations influence GPi and GPe in primates."

            "This study presents an analysis of the distribution and organization pattern of axons originating from the substantia nigra pars reticulata and projecting to the thalamus in monkeys. Biotin dextran amine was iontophoretically injected into different parts of the substantia nigra pars reticulata of monkeys (African green monkeys and macaques). In whatever part of the substantia nigra the injection was made, numerous axonal endings were found to be distributed within different thalamic regions: the ventral anterior nucleus and mainly its magnocellular part, the most ventromedial part of the ventral lateral nucleus, and the mediodorsal and parafascicular nuclei. Moreover, the nigrothalamic projection appeared to be topographically organized. Ten anterogradely labeled axons were reconstructed from serial sections. The axons terminated in three to six terminal fields per axon located in a relatively small portion of only one thalamic region. These terminal fields were variable in size and comprised 4-43 very thin, varicose branches. They consisted either of different axonal branches of the same axon or of different axons and covered 10-31 thalamic cell bodies. These findings demonstrate that the overall morphological organization of individual nigral axons is complex and allows single axons to influence thalamic neurons via a combination of divergent, convergent, and amplification processes."

        "abstract": [
            "How the motor-related cortical areas modulate the activity of the output nuclei of the basal ganglia is an important issue for understanding the mechanisms of motor control by the basal ganglia. In the present study, by using awake monkeys, the polysynaptic effects of electrical stimulation in the forelimb regions of the primary motor and primary somatosensory cortices on the activity of globus pallidus (GP) neurons, especially mediated by the subthalamic nucleus (STN), have been characterized. Cortical stimulation induced an early, short-latency excitation followed by an inhibition and a late excitation in neurons of both the external and internal segments of the GP. It also induced an early, short-latency excitation followed by a late excitation and an inhibition in STN neurons. The early excitation in STN neurons preceded that in GP neurons. Blockade of STN neuronal activity by muscimol (GABA(A) receptor agonist) injection resulted in abolishment of both the early and late excitations evoked in GP neurons by cortical stimulation. At the same time, the spontaneous discharge rate of GP neurons decreased, pauses between the groups of spikes of GP neurons became prominent, and the firing pattern became regular. Injection of (+/-)-3-(2-carboxypiperazin-4-yl)-propyl-1-phosphonic acid (CPP) [N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist], but not 1,2,3, 4-tetrahydro-6-nitro-2,3-dioxo-benzo[f]quinoxaline-7-sulfonamide disodium [NBQX (non-NMDA receptor antagonist)], into the STN attenuated the early and late excitations in GP neurons, suggesting that cortico-subthalamic transmission is mediated mainly by NMDA receptors. Interference with the pallido-subthalamic transmission by bicuculline (GABA(A) receptor antagonist) injection into the STN made the inhibition distinct without affecting the early excitation. The present results indicate that the cortico-subthalamo-pallidal pathway conveys powerful excitatory effects from the motor-related cortical areas to the GP with shorter conduction time than the effects conveyed through the striatum."

            "The subthalamic nucleus (STN) is considered a homogeneous structure composed essentially of projection neurons that exert a profound glutamate-mediated excitatory influence upon the main output structures of the basal ganglia. It is currently the most efficient target for deep brain stimulations designed to alleviate symptoms of Parkinson's disease. STN neurons were analyzed by applying stereological methods and single/double-immunostaining procedures to postmortem material obtained from normal individuals. Besides a multitude of closely packed projection neurons ( approximately 24.7 mum in diameter), the human STN (mean volume, 174.5 +/- 20.4 mm3; total neuronal density, 239.5 +/- 31.9 x 10(3)) contained smaller neurons (approximately 12.2 microm), which displayed glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD)(65/67) immunoreactivity and shared the morphological features of interneurons described in Golgi studies of primate STN. These putative gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)ergic interneurons accounted for 7.5% of the total neuronal population of the STN. Although present throughout the nucleus, they were significantly more numerous in its posterior-ventral-medial sector, which belongs to the limbic/associative functional territory. Many projection neurons located dorsolaterally in the STN showed parvalbumin immunoreactivity and others lying ventromedially displayed calretinin immunostaining, but none of the GAD-positive interneurons expressed these calcium-binding proteins. Although less abundant than projection neurons, GABAergic interneurons might play a important role in the intrinsic organization of the STN. The morphological and chemical heterogeneity of the human STN reported here might have important implications in the functional organization of the basal ganglia."

        "abstract": [
            "Axonal projections arising from the external segment of the globus pallidus (GPe) in cynomolgus monkeys (Macaca fascicularis) were mapped after labeling small pools (5-15 cells) of neurons with biotinylated dextran amine. Seventy-six single axons were reconstructed from serial sagittal sections with a camera lucida. The majority of labeled GPe cells displayed long, aspiny, and poorly branched dendrites that arborized mostly along the sagittal plane, whereas others showed dendrites radiating in all directions. Numerous GPe axons emitted short, intranuclear collaterals that arborized close to their parent cell body. Based on their axonal targets, four distinct types of GPe projection neurons have been identified: 1) neurons that project to the internal segment of the globus pallidus (GPi), the subthalamic nucleus (STN), and the substantia nigra, pars reticulata (SNr; 13.2%); 2) neurons that target the GPi and the STN (18.4%); 3) neurons that project to the STN and the SNr (52.6%); and 4) neurons that target the striatum (15.8%). Labeled GPe axons displayed large varicosities that often were closely apposed to the somata and proximal dendrites of STN, GPi, and SNr neurons. At striatal levels, however, GPe axons displayed small axonal varicosities that did not form perineuronal nets. These results suggest that the GPe is an important integrative locus in primate basal ganglia. This nucleus harbors several subtypes of projection neurons that are endowed with a highly patterned set of collaterals. This organization allows single GPe neurons to exert a multifarious effect not only on the STN, which is the claimed GPe target, but also on the two major output structures of the basal ganglia, the SNr and the GPi."

            "The axonal projections of the internal pallidum (GPi) in cynomolgus monkeys (Macaca fascicularis) were studied by labeling small pools of neurons with biotinylated dextran amine. Fifty-two axons were reconstructed entirely from serial sections with a camera lucida. Two types of projection neurons were identified in the GPi on the basis of their target sites. The abundant and centrally located type I neurons gave rise to a long axonal branch that descended directly to the pedunculopontine tegmental nucleus, where it arborized discretely. Other branches ascended to the thalamus and broke into 10-15 thinner collaterals that ran through most of the ventral anterior nucleus, where they terminated as typical plexuses. About half of these axons gave rise to collaterals that arborized in both components of the centre median/parafascicular thalamic complex. The less numerous and peripherally located type II neurons had an axon that climbed the rostral thalamic pole, coursed along the stria medullaris, and arborized profusely within the lateral habenular nucleus, which stood out as the most densely innervated pallidal target. Some type II axons provided collaterals to the anterior thalamic nuclei. A small proportion of axons of both types had branches that crossed the midline and terminated in contralateral GPi target structures. Three-dimensional reconstruction showed that type I axons arborized principally along the sagittal plane. These data reveal that GPi neurons of type I act through a widely distributed axonal network upon thalamic and brainstem premotor neurons, whereas type II neurons act in a much more focused manner upon lateral habenular neurons."

            "The organization of the pallidofugal fiber system originating from the internal segment of the globus pallidus (GPi) in cynomolgus monkeys (Macaca fascicularis) was studied by means of a single-axon tracing method. The primate GPi is composed of a majority of neurons endowed with a highly collateralized axon that projects to the premotor neurons located in the ventral tier thalamic nuclei, the center-median/parafascicular thalamic complex and the brainstem pedunculopontine nucleus. These axons often follow a long and tortuous course within the GPi and then emerge either through the ansa lenticularis (AL) or the lenticular fasciculus (LF), irrespective of the location of their parent cell body in the GPi. Other pallidofugal axons exit through the medial pole of the GPi, at various distances between the AL ventrally and the LF dorsally. Virtually all pallidofugal axons course through Forel's field H, on their way to the thalamus and brainstem. They emit numerous short collaterals and boutons en passant in this sector of the subthalamic region, which stands out as a major target of GPi axons. Our results indicate that AL and LF do not form separate anatomical entities, each carrying axons originating from distinct functional pallidal territories, as commonly believed. Instead, these two fascicles form the ventral and dorsal borders of a morphological continuum that harbors a multitude of pallidofugal axons arising from all sectors of the GPi. This type of information should be taken into account when interpreting data from deep brain stimulation applied to pallidal and subthalamic regions in Parkinson's disease."

        ], 
        "abstract": [
            "In primates, thalamostriatal projections from the centromedian (CM) and parafascicular (Pf) nuclei are strong and organized according to a strict pattern of functional connectivity with various regions of the striatal complex. In turn, the CM/Pf complex receives a substantial innervation from the internal globus pallidus (GPi). In this study, we demonstrate that the substantia nigra pars reticulata (SNr) also provides a massive input to Pf in monkeys. These pallidothalamic and nigrothalamic projections provide routes whereby information can flow in functional loops between the basal ganglia and the intralaminar nuclear group. To understand better the anatomical organization and the degree of functional specificity of these loops, we combined retrograde and anterograde labeling methods from functionally defined regions of the striatum and GPi/SNr to determine the relationships between thalamostriatal neurons and basal ganglia afferents. Together with previous studies, our data suggest the existence of tightly connected functional circuits between the basal ganglia and the CM/Pf in primates: 1) A \"sensorimotor\" circuit links together the medial two-thirds of CM, the postcommissural putamen, and the ventrolateral part of the caudal GPi; 2) a \"limbic\" circuit involves the rostral one-third of Pf, the ventral striatum, and the rostromedial pole of GPi; and 3) an \"associative\"circuit exists between the caudal two-thirds of Pf, the caudate nucleus, and the SNr. An additional \"associative\" circuit that involves the caudate-receiving territory of GPi (dorsal one-third), the dorsolateral Pf (Pfdl), and the precommissural putamen was also disclosed. In conclusion, findings of this study provide additional evidence for the high degree of functional specificity of the thalamostriatal system through which CM/Pf may provide attention-specific sensory information important for conditional responses to the primate striatum."

        ], 
        "abstract": [
            "To address the question of segregated projections from the internal segment of the globus pallidus (GPi) and the cerebellar nuclei (Cb) to the thalamus in the monkey, we employed a double anterograde labeling strategy combining the anterograde transport of horseradish peroxidase conjugated to wheat germ agglutinin (WGA-HRP) with biotinylated dextran amine (BDA) transport. The tissue was processed sequentially for WGA-HRP, and then BDA immunohistochemistry using two different chromogens. Since the two labels were easily distinguishable on the same histological section, the interrelationship between the cerebellar and pallidal projection systems could be directly evaluated. We found that both the cerebellothalamic and pallidothalamic label consisted of dense plexuses of labeled fibers and swellings in a patch-like configuration. The patches or foci of labeling were distributed either as dense single label or as interdigitating patches of double label. We found dense single label in the central portion of the ventral anterior nucleus pars principalis (VApc) and the ventral lateral nucleus pars oralis (VLo) following the GPi injections or in the central portion of the ventral posterior lateral nucleus pars oralis (VPLo) and nucleus X (X) following the cerebellar nuclei injections. Complementary interdigitating patches of WGA-HRP and BDA labeling were found primarily in transitional border regions between thalamic nuclei. On occasion, we found overlap of both labels. We observed a gradient pattern in the density of the pallidothalamic and cerebellothalamic projections. The pallidothalamic territory included VApc, VLo, and the ventral lateral nucleus pars caudalis (VLc), with the density of these projections decreasing along an anterior to posterior gradient in the thalamus. Occasional patches of pallidal label were found in VPLo and nucleus X. Conversely, the density of cerebellothalamic projections increased along the same gradient, with the cerebellothalamic territory extending anteriorly beyond the cell-sparse zones of VPLo, X, and VLc to include VLo and VApc also. These data suggest that although the cerebellar and pallidal projections primarily occupy separate thalamic territories, individual thalamic nuclei receive differentially weighted inputs from these sources."

        ], 
        "abstract": [
            "The basal ganglia and frontal cortex operate together to execute goal directed behaviors. This requires not only the execution of motor plans, but also the behaviors that lead to this execution, including emotions and motivation that drive behaviors, cognition that organizes and plans the general strategy, motor planning, and finally, the execution of that plan. The components of the frontal cortex that mediate these behaviors, are reflected in the organization, physiology, and connections between areas of frontal cortex and in their projections through basal ganglia circuits. This comprises a series of parallel pathways. However, this model does not address how information flows between circuits thereby developing new learned behaviors (or actions) from a combination of inputs from emotional, cognitive, and motor cortical areas. Recent anatomical evidence from primates demonstrates that the neuro-networks within basal ganglia pathways are in a position to move information across functional circuits. Two networks are: the striato-nigral-striatal network and the thalamo-cortical-thalamic network. Within each of these sets of connected structures, there are both reciprocal connections linking up regions associated with similar functions and non-reciprocal connections linking up regions that are associated with different cortical basal ganglia circuits. Each component of information (from limbic to motor outcome) sends both feedback connection, and also a feedforward connection, allowing the transfer of information. Information is channeled from limbic, to cognitive, to motor circuits. Action decision-making processes are thus influenced by motivation and cognitive inputs, allowing the animal to respond appropriate to environmental cues."

        ], 
        "abstract": [
            "The basal ganglia (BG) have received much attention during the last 3 decades mainly because of their clinical relevance. Our understanding of their structure, organisation and function in terms of chemoarchitecture, compartmentalisation, connections and receptor localisation has increased equally. Most of the research has been focused on the mammalian BG, but a considerable number of studies have been carried out in nonmammalian vertebrates, in particular reptiles and birds. The BG of the latter 2 classes of vertebrates, which together with mammals constitute the amniotic vertebrates, have been thoroughly studied by means of tract-tracing and immunohistochemical techniques. The terminology used for amniotic BG structures has frequently been adopted to indicate putative corresponding structures in the brain of anamniotes, i.e. amphibians and fishes, but data for such a comparison were, until recently, almost totally lacking. It has been proposed several times that the occurrence of well developed BG structures probably constitutes a landmark in the anamniote-amniote transition. However, our recent studies of connections, chemoarchitecture and development of the basal forebrain of amphibians have revealed that tetrapod vertebrates share a common pattern of BG organisation. This pattern includes the existence of dorsal and ventral striatopallidal systems, reciprocal connections between the striatopallidal complex and the diencephalic and mesencephalic basal plate (striatonigral and nigrostriatal projections), and descending pathways from the striatopallidal system to the midbrain tectum and reticular formation. The connectional similarities are paralleled by similarities in the distribution of chemical markers of striatal and pallidal structures such as dopamine, substance P and enkephalin, as well as by similarities in development and expression of homeobox genes. On the other hand, a major evolutionary trend is the progressive involvement of the cortex in the processing of the thalamic sensory information relayed to the BG of tetrapods. By using the comparative approach, new insights have been gained with respect to certain features of the BG of vertebrates in general, such as the segmental organisation of the midbrain dopaminergic cell groups, the occurrence of large numbers of dopaminergic cell bodies within the telencephalon itself and the variability in, among others, connectivity and chemoarchitecture. However, the intriguing question whether the basal forebrain organisation of nontetrapods differs essentially from that observed in tetrapods still needs to be answered."

Recently, the discovery of cytochemical markers that are specific for each of the major classes of striatal interneurones, and the combination of this with intracellular recording and staining, has revealed the identities of interneurones and some of their functional characteristics in a way that could not have been imagined by the classical morphologists. These methods also suggest some possible modes of action of interneurones in the neostriatal circuitry."

            "The present study is aimed at evaluating the relative number and comparing the pattern of distribution of interneurons containing calretinin (CR), parvalbumin (PV) or NADPH-d in the striatum of rats, squirrel monkeys and humans. A series of adjacent coronal sections taken at three comparable rostrocaudal levels in the three species were treated to reveal the three neuronal markers and the density of each type of chemospecific interneurons was analyzed with a computerized image analysis system. In primates, the most abundant interneurons were those expressing CR. The ratio of CR+/PV+ neurons was approximately 2-3:1 compared to a ratio of 3-4:1 for CR+/NADPH-d+ neurons. In contrast, the most frequently encountered interneurons in the rat striatum were those expressing PV. In rodents, all three interneurons were more abundant rostrally than caudally, but CR+ neurons displayed a particularly striking rostrocaudal decreasing gradient. In monkeys and humans, the three striatal interneurons were distributed rather uniformly rostrocaudally, but CR+ and PV+ interneurons were significantly more numerous in the caudate nucleus than in the putamen in humans. In monkeys, only PV+ neurons were more abundant in the caudate nucleus than in putamen. Overall, the density of the three striatal interneurons was much higher in monkeys than in rats and humans. These results reveal important species differences in respect to the relative density and pattern of distribution of striatal interneurons. These findings should be taken into account when evaluating the effect of neurodegenerative processes on cell densities in the human striatum or when studying animal models of the such diseases."

            "Mammals adapt to a rapidly changing world because of the sophisticated cognitive functions that are supported by the neocortex. The neocortex, which forms almost 80% of the human brain, seems to have arisen from repeated duplication of a stereotypical microcircuit template with subtle specializations for different brain regions and species. The quest to unravel the blueprint of this template started more than a century ago and has revealed an immensely intricate design. The largest obstacle is the daunting variety of inhibitory interneurons that are found in the circuit. This review focuses on the organizing principles that govern the diversity of inhibitory interneurons and their circuits."

        "abstract": [
            "Inhibitory interneurons of the neocortex are electrically coupled to cells of the same type through gap junctions. We studied the spatial organization of two types of interneurons in the rat somatosensory cortex: fast-spiking (FS) parvalbumin-immunoreactive (PV+) cells, and low threshold-spiking (LTS) somatostatin-immunoreactive (SS+) cells. Paired recordings in layer 4 demonstrated that both the probability of coupling and the coupling coefficient drop steeply with intersomatic distance, reaching zero beyond 200 microm. The dendritic arbors of FS and LTS cells were reconstructed from electrophysiologically characterized, biocytin-filled cells; the two cell types had only minor differences in the number and span of their dendrites. However, there was a markedly higher density of PV+ cells than SS+ cells. PV+ cells were densest in layer 4, while SS+ cell density peaked in the subgranular layers. From these data we estimate that there is measurable electrical coupling (directly or indirectly via intermediary cells) between each interneuron and 20-50 others. The large number of electrical synapses implies that each interneuron participates in a large, continuous syncytium. To evaluate the functional significance of these findings, we examined several simple architectures of coupled networks analytically. We present a mathematical method to estimate the average summated coupling conductance that each cell receives from all of its neighbors, and the average leak conductance of individual cells, and we suggest that these have the same order of magnitude. These quantitative results have important implications for the effects of electrical coupling on the dynamic behavior of interneuron networks."

There are many types of inhibitory neurons, but their synaptic organization is poorly understood. Here we describe two functionally distinct inhibitory networks comprising either fast-spiking (FS) or low-threshold spiking (LTS) neurons. Paired-cell recordings showed that inhibitory neurons of the same type were strongly interconnected by electrical synapses, but electrical synapses between different inhibitory cell types were rare. The electrical synapses were strong enough to synchronize spikes in coupled interneurons. Inhibitory chemical synapses were also common between FS cells, and between FS and LTS cells, but LTS cells rarely inhibited one another. Thalamocortical synapses, which convey sensory information to the cortex, specifically and strongly excited only the FS cell network. The electrical and chemical synaptic connections of different types of inhibitory neurons are specific, and may allow each inhibitory network to function independently."

            "Cortical variation in mammals and other terrestrial vertebrates, re-examined by current comparative methodology (out-group analysis), indicates that separate lateral (olfactory), dorsal and medial (hippocampal) pallial or cortical formations arose with the origin of vertebrates. Although the exact origin of mammalian isocortex (so-called neocortex) is still disputed, it appears that the earliest mammals already had a six-layered isocortex with ten to 20 functional subdivisions. Among placental mammals, at least, isocortex has expanded numerous times, producing additional cortical subdivisions. Because these expansions were independent transformations of a simpler cortex, they produced subdivisions that are not homologous."

        ], 
        "abstract": [
            "The companion paper (Gabbott and Bacon [1996] J. Comp. Neurol.) describes the morphology of calretinin (CR)-, parvalbumin (PV)-, calbindin (CB)-, and GABA-immunoreactive neurons, and NADPH diaphorase-reactive cells, in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC; areas 24a, 24b, 24c, 25 and 32) of the adult monkey. Since these local circuit neurons play crucial functional roles, the aim of this study was to provide supportive quantitative data defining their areal and laminar distribution in mPFC. The numerical densities of neurons (Nv, number of cells per mm3) in each area and layer were calculated stereologically. The mean total neuronal NV estimates across mPFC was 55,727 +/- 3,319 per mm3 (mean +/- S.D.; n = 3); values ranged from 50,489 +/- 8,374 per mm3 (area 24a) to 59,938 +/- 7,214 per mm3 (area 24c). Interareal differences were not significant. Cortical depth measurements and neuronal NV estimates for each area allowed the absolute number of neurons in a column of cortex under 1 mm2 of surface to be calculated; values varied between 86,457 +/- 15,063 (area 24a) and 128,464 +/- 24,050 (area 24c). Using immunolabelled Nissl-stained sections of mPFC, CR+ neurons constituted 11.2%, PV+ neurons 5.9%, and CB+ neurons 5.0% of the total neuron population. GABA+ neurons represented an overall 24.9% (23.5-27.3%) of neurons in the mPFC. Differences between areas were not significant. The cortical depth distribution histograms of CR+, PV+, CB+, and GABA+ cell populations in each area were derived and the percentage of a given cell population in each layer subsequently calculated. Peaks in the cortical depth distributions of CR+ and CB+ neurons occurred in layer 2 and upper layer 3, respectively; the peak distribution of PV+ neurons occurred between lower layer 3 and upper layer 5. The depth distribution of GABA+ cells reflected the combined distributions of CR+, PV+ and CR+ neurons. In all areas, the majority (74.4-84.0%) of the GABA cell population was located in layers 2/3. The depth distributions for each cell type were similar between areas. Diaphorase-reactive neurons accounted for 0.25% (0.2-0.32%) of all cortical neurons in mPFC and were distributed in two horizontal strata, in midlayer 3 and in mid/upper layer 6. A large population of diaphorase-reactive cells was present in the white matter. The absolute numbers of CR+, PV+, CB+ and GABA+ neurons within individual layers in a column of cortex under 1 mm2 and 50 x 50 microns of cortical surface have been derived. The data presented provide the basis for a quantitative definition of cortical circuits in monkey mPFC."

            "This paper provides a comprehensive morphological description of local circuit neurons in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC: areas 24a, 24b, 24c, 25 and 32) of the monkey. Cortical interneurons were identified immunocytochemically by the expression of the calcium binding proteins calretinin (CR), parvalbumin (PV) and calbindin D-28k (CB). Interneurons were also identified using GABA immunocytochemistry. The areal and laminar distributions of CR, PV, and CB cells were consistent across mPFC; their morphological characteristics identified them as local circuit neurons. Throughout layers 2-6: CR immunoreactivity labelled double bouquet and bipolar neurons, PV was localised in large and small basket neurons and in chandelier (axoaxonic) cells, while CB immunoreactivity was present in double bouquet, Martinotti, and neurogliaform neurons. In addition, some cells in layer 1 (including Cajal-Retzius neurons) were CR immunoreactive. Calbindin immunoreactivity also labelled a population of large nonpyramidal neurons deep in the cortex. Other types of CR, PV and CB cells were also immunolabelled. A small population of layer 3 pyramidal cells was weakly CB immunoreactive. Peak cell densities occurred in layer 2/upper layer 3 for CR+ neurons and in upper to midlayer 3 for CB+ cells. PV+ neuron density peaked in midcortex. These observations support and extend a similar study of monkey prefrontal cortex (Conde et al. [1994] J. Comp. Neurol. 341:95-116). The morphologies and combined cortical depth distributions of CR+, PV+, and CB+ neurons were similar to GABA-immunolabelled cells. Local circuit neurons in mPFC displaying NADPH diaphorase activity composed less than 0.25% of the total neuron population, and were distributed in two horizontal strata, in mid- to lower layer 3 and in lower layer 5/upper layer 6. CR, PV and CB immunoreactivity was colocalised in NADPH diaphorase-reactive neurons. The interrelationships between CR+, PV+ and CB+ neurons were investigated using dual immunocytochemistry. CR+ puncta were found to be closely associated with the cell bodies and proximal processes of PV+ neurons, whereas CR+ puncta were located more distally over processes from CB+ cells. Additionally, PV+ puncta were found closely apposed to PV+ somata and processes and CR+ puncta abutted against CR+ cell bodies. The companion paper (Gabbott and Bacon [1996] J. Comp. Neurol.) presents quantitative data regarding the areal and laminar distributions of the identified cell classes in mPFC. Such data provide a realistic structural framework with which to investigate neuronal operations in monkey mPFC."

        ], 
        "abstract": [
            "This paper is a light microscopical study describing the detailed morphology and quantitative distribution of local circuit neurones in areas 25, 32, and 24b of the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) in the rat. Cortical interneurones were identified immunocytochemically by their expression of calretinin (CR), parvalbumin (PV), and calbindin D-28k (CB) immunoreactivity. Neurones immunoreactive for gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) were also investigated, as were interneurones containing reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) diaphorase activity. Several distinct classes of CR+, PV+, and CB+ neurones were identified; the most frequent were: bipolar/bitufted CR+ cells in upper layer 3; multipolar PV+ neurones in layers 3 and 5; and bitufted/multipolar CB+ neurones in lower layer 3. CB+ neurones resembling Martinotti and neurogliaform cells were also present in layers 5/6. The morphologies and depth distributions of each cell type were consistent across the three areas of mPFC studied. Seven classes of diaphorase-reactive mPFC neurone are described; these cells were composed about 0.8% of the total neurone population and had a peak distribution located in mid- to lower layer 5 in each area. In areas 32 and 25, three defined bands of diffuse NADPH diaphorase staining were located in layer 2 and in upper and deep layer 5. Diaphorase reactivity was very infrequently colocalised with either CR, PV, or CB immunoreactivities. The numerical densities of neurones (N(V), number of cells per mm3) in each layer were calculated stereologically. The mean total neuronal N(V) estimate for areas 25, 32, and 24b was 51,603 +/- 3,324 (mean +/- S.D.; n = 8). Significant interareal differences were detected. From cortical thickness data and neuronal N(V) estimates, the absolute number of neurones under 1 mm2 of cortical surface (N(C)) have been derived. The mean N(C) value for areas 25, 32, and 24b was 57,328 +/- 7,505 neurones. In immunolabelled Nissl-stained sections, CR+ neurones constituted an overall 4.0%, PV+ cells 5.6%, and CB+ 3.4% of the total neurone populations in mPFC. GABA+ cells represented a mean of 16.2% (14.8-17.2%) of neurones in areas 25, 32 and 24b. The absolute numbers of CR+, PV+, CB+, and GABA+ neurones within individual layers in a column of cortex under 1 mm2 of cortical surface (N(L)) have also been derived, with significant interareal differences in N(L) values being detected. The data provide the structural basis for a qualitative and quantitative definition of local cortical circuits in the rat mPFC."

        "abstract": [
            "In the primate neocortex, little is known about the possible associations between functional subclasses of GABA neurons, their morphological properties and calcium-binding protein (CaBP) content. We used whole-cell current clamp recordings, combined with intracellular labeling and fluorescence immunohistochemistry, to determine these relationships for interneurons in layers 2-3 of monkey prefrontal cortex (PFC). Eighty-one interneurons were included in the analysis. Thirty-eight of these cells showed immunoreactivity for one of the three CaBPs tested. Co-localization of more than one CaBP was not observed in any of the interneurons examined. Interneurons with different CaBPs formed distinct populations with specific physiological membrane properties and morphological features. Parvalbumin (PV)-positive cells had the physiological properties characteristic of fast-spiking interneurons (FS) and the morphology of basket or chandelier neurons. Most calretinin (CR)-containing cells had the physiological properties ascribed to non-fast-spiking cells (non-FS) and a vertically oriented axonal morphology, similar to that of double bouquet cells. Calbindin (CB)-positive interneurons also had non-FS properties and included cells with double bouquet morphology or with a characteristic dense web of axonal collaterals in layer 1. Classification of the interneurons based on cluster analysis of multiple electrophysiological properties suggested the existence of at least two distinct groups of interneurons. The first group contained mainly PV-positive FS cells and the second group consisted predominantly of CR- and CB-positive non-FS interneurons. These findings may help to illuminate the functional roles of different groups of interneurons in primate PFC circuitry."

            "Multiple lines of evidence indicate that the performance of complex cognitive processes, such as those involving working memory, depend upon the functional properties of the circuitry of the prefrontal cortex (PFC). In primates, working memory has been proposed to be dependent upon the sustained activity of specific populations of PFC pyramidal cells, with this activity regulated by certain types of GABAergic interneurons. Thus, knowledge of the connectivity between PFC pyramidal cells and interneurons is crucial to the understanding the neural mechanisms that subserve working memory. This paper reviews recent findings that reveal specificity in the spatial organization, synaptic targets and postnatal development of pyramidal cells and interneurons in the primate prefrontal cortex, and considers the relevance of these findings for the neural circuitry that subserves working memory."

        ], 
        "abstract": [
            "In monkey prefrontal cortex (PFC), approximately 50% of the local axon terminals of pyramidal neurons form synapses with the dendritic shafts of GABA neurons. Subclasses of GABA neurons can be distinguished by the presence of different calcium-binding proteins. For example, in monkey PFC, parvalbumin (PV)-containing cells comprise approximately 25% of GABA neurons and are predominantly located in layers 3b-4, whereas calretinin (CR)-containing cells, which are present in greatest density in layers 2-3a, constitute 50% of GABA neurons. Consequently, in order to determine the cell class and laminar specificity of the dendritic targets of pyramidal neuron local axon collaterals in monkey PFC area 9, we conducted ultrastructural analyses of local axon terminals labeled with the anterograde tracer, biotinylated dextran amine, and dendrites immunoreactive (IR) for PV or CR. In layer 3b, the majority of the local axon terminals targeted PV-IR dendritic shafts, whereas CR-IR dendritic shafts were targeted infrequently. This differential targeting was also present in layers 2-3a, although it was less pronounced. In addition, PV-IR dendrites had a significantly greater density of excitatory inputs than did CR-IR dendrites. These findings indicate that PV-containing interneurons, which have a potent inhibitory effect on pyramidal neurons, are selectively targeted by the excitatory local axon terminals of supragranular pyramidal neurons in monkey PFC. These connections may provide the anatomical substrate for the coordinated activity of pyramidal neurons and fast-spiking GABA neurons during working memory."

        ], 
        "abstract": [
            "In the cerebral cortex, local circuit neurons provide critical inhibitory control over the activity of pyramidal neurons, the major class of excitatory efferent cortical cells. The calcium-binding proteins, calretinin, calbindin, and parvalbumin, are expressed in a variety of cortical local circuit neurons. However, in the primate prefrontal cortex, relatively little is known, especially with regard to calretinin, about the specific classes or distribution of local circuit neurons that contain these calcium-binding proteins. In this study, we used immunohistochemical techniques to characterize and compare the morphological features and distribution in macaque monkey prefrontal cortex of local circuit neurons that contain each of these calcium-binding proteins. On the basis of the axonal features of the labeled neurons, and correlations with previous Golgi studies, calretinin appeared to be present in double-bouquet neurons, calbindin in neurogliaform neurons and Martinotti cells, and parvalbumin in chandelier and wide arbor (basket) neurons. Calretinin was also found in other cell populations, such as a distinctive group of large neurons in the infragranular layers, but it was not possible to assign these neurons to a known cell class. In addition, although the animals studied were adults, immunoreactivity for both calretinin and calbindin was found in Cajal-Retzius neurons of layer I. Dual labeling studies confirmed that with the exception of the Cajal-Retzius neurons, each calcium-binding protein was expressed in separate populations of prefrontal cortical neurons. Comparisons of the laminar distributions of the labeled neurons also indicated that these calcium-binding proteins were segregated into discrete neuronal populations. Calretinin-positive neurons were present in greatest density in deep layer I and layer II, calbindin-immunoreactive cells were most dense in layers II-superficial III, and parvalbumin-containing neurons were present in greatest density in the middle cortical layers. In addition, the relative density of calretinin-labeled neurons was approximately twice that of the calbindin- and parvalbumin-positive neurons. However, within each group of labeled neurons, their laminar distribution and relative density did not differ substantially across regions of the prefrontal cortex. These findings demonstrate that calretinin, calbindin, and parvalbumin are markers of separate populations of local circuit neurons in monkey prefrontal cortex, and that they may be useful tools in unraveling the intrinsic inhibitory circuitry of the primate prefrontal cortex in but normal and disease states."

        "abstract": [
            "Immunocytochemical techniques were used to examine the distribution of double-bouquet cells and chandelier cells that were immunoreactive (-ir) for the calcium-binding proteins calbindin (CB), calretinin (CR), and parvalbumin (PV) in the primary visual area (V1), the second visual area (V2), and cytoarchitectonic area TE in the macaque monkey. Furthermore, the connections between CB-, CR-, and PV-ir neurons in these visual areas were investigated at the light microscope level by using a dual-immunocytochemical staining procedure. The most significant findings were three-fold. First, the number and distribution of CB-ir and CR-ir double-bouquet cells and PV-ir chandelier cells differed considerably between different visual areas. In particular, the different distribution of double-bouquet cells was illustrated dramatically at the V1/V2 border, where CB-ir double-bouquet axons were very few or lacking in V1 but were very numerous in V2. Furthermore, PV-ir chandelier cell terminals were relatively sparse in V1, more frequent in V2, and most frequent in area TE. Second, the percentage of CB-, CR-, and PV-ir neurons receiving multiple contacts on their somata and proximal dendrites from other calcium-binding protein neurons varied between 22% and 85%. The highest percentage of contacts found between immunolabelled cells and multiterminals were for the combinations CR/CB (76-85%; percent of cells immunoreactive for CB that were innervated by multiterminals immunoreactive for CR), followed by the combination PV/CR (42-48%), and then by the other combinations that had similar percentages (22-32% for CR/PV; 26-37% for CB/CR; 29-42% for CR/PV). Third, differences in the relative proportions of CB, CR, and PV terminals in contact with CB-, CR-, and PV-ir neurons were consistent between the different cortical areas studied. Thus, certain characteristics of intraareal circuits differ, whereas others remain similar, in different areas of the occipitotemporal visual pathway. The differences may represent regional specializations related to the different processing of visual stimuli, whereas the similarities may be attributed to general functional requisites for interneuronal circuitry."

        "abstract": [
            "This article provides a general account of types of neurons, synaptic connections and chemical characteristics (colocalization studies) of cells immunoreactive for the three main calcium-binding proteins found in the neocortex, namely, calbindin-D28K, parvalbumin and calretinin. The main conclusion is two-fold. First, all, or the majority, of calbindin-, parvalbumin- and calretinin-immunoreactive cells are smooth nonpyramidal neurons (interneurons) which participate in a variety of complex cortical circuits that may differ depending on the species, cortical area or layer where they are located. Second, in general, different types of nonpyramidal neurons are stained for each of these calcium-binding proteins and display different chemical characteristics regarding a variety of neurotransmitters (or related compounds), cell surface markers and receptors. However, a certain overlap exits, which also shows regional and species differences."

            "Synaptic targets of the intrinsic axon collaterals of supragranular pyramidal neurons in monkey prefrontal cortex"
        ], 
        "abstract": [
            "The principal axons of supragranular pyramidal neurons in the cerebral cortex travel through the white matter and terminate in other cortical areas, whereas their intrinsic axon collaterals course through the gray matter and form both local and long-distance connections within a cortical region. In the monkey prefrontal cortex (PFC), horizontally oriented, intrinsic axon collaterals from supragranular pyramidal neurons form a series of stripe-like clusters of axon terminals (Levitt et al. [1993] J Comp Neurol 338:360-376; Pucak et al. [1996] J Comp Neurol 376:614-630). The present study examined the synaptic targets of the intrinsic axon collaterals arising from supragranular pyramidal neurons within the same stripe (local projections). Approximately 50% of the within-stripe axon terminals in monkey PFC area 9 targeted dendritic spines. In contrast, for both the intrinsic axon collaterals that travel between stripes (long-range projections), and the axon terminals that project to other PFC areas (associational projections), over 92% of the postsynaptic structures were dendritic spines (Melchitzky et al. [1998] J Comp Neurol 390:211-224). The other 50% of the within-stripe terminals synapsed with dendritic shafts. Dual-labeling studies confirmed that these within-stripe terminals contacted gamma-aminobutyric acid-immunoreactive dendritic shafts, including the subpopulation that contains the calcium-binding protein parvalbumin. The functional significance of the differences in synaptic targets between local and long-range intrinsic axon collaterals was supported by whole-cell, patch clamp recordings in an in vitro slice preparation of monkey PFC. Specifically, the small amplitude responses observed in layer 3 pyramidal neurons during long-range, low-intensity stimulation were exclusively excitatory, whereas local stimulation also evoked di/polysynaptic inhibitory responses. These anatomic and electrophysiological findings suggest that intrinsic connections of the PFC differ from other cortical regions and that within the PFC, feedback (within-stripe) inhibition plays a greater role in regulating the activity of supragranular pyramidal neurons than does feedforward inhibition either between stripes or across regions."

        "abstract": [
            "Electron microscopy and immunocytochemistry with a monoclonal antibody against parvalbumin (PV) were combined to analyze the distribution and morphology of PV-immunoreactive (PV-IR) neurons and the synaptology of PV-IR processes in the principal sulcus of the macaque prefrontal cortex. Parvalbumin-IR neurons are present in layers II-VI of the macaque principal sulcus (Walker's area 46) and are concentrated in a band centered around layer IV. PV-IR cells are exclusively non-pyramidal in shape and are morphologically heterogeneous with soma sizes ranging from less than 10 microns to greater than 20 microns. Well-labeled neurons that could be classified on the basis of soma size and dendritic configuration resembled large basket and chandelier cells. A novel finding is that supragranular PV-IR neurons exhibit dendritic patterns with predominantly vertical orientations, whereas infragranular cells exhibit mostly horizontal or oblique dendritic orientations. PV-IR cells within layer IV exhibit a mixture of dendritic arrangements. Vertical rows of PV-IR puncta, 15-30 microns in length, resembling the \"cartridges\" of chandelier cell axons were most dense in layers II, superficial III, and the granular layer IV but were not observed in the infragranular layers. Cartridges were often present beneath unlabeled, presumed pyramidal cells. PV-IR puncta also formed pericellular nests around pyramidal cell somata and proximal dendrites, suggestive of basket cell innervation. PV-IR axons were occasionally observed in the white matter underlying the principal sulcus. Electron microscopic analysis revealed that PV-IR somata and dendrites are densely innervated by nonimmunoreactive terminals forming asymmetric (Gray type I) synapses as well as by fewer terminals forming symmetric (Gray type II) synapses. The majority of terminals forming symmetric synapses with PV-IR post-synaptic structures were not immunolabeled; however, some of these boutons did contain PV-immunoreactivity. PV-IR boutons exclusively form symmetric synapses and heavily innervate layer II/III pyramidal cells. PV-IR axon cartridges formed numerous axo-axonic synapses with the axon initial segments of pyramidal cells 15-20 microns beneath the axon hillock and also terminated on large axonal spines of the initial segment. Furthermore, we failed to observe a mixture of PV-immunoreactive and non-immunoreactive boutons composing a single axon cartridge. Pyramidal cell somata and proximal dendrites were also heavily innervated by PV-IR boutons forming symmetric synapses, again, consistent with basket cell innervation. In addition, PV-IR axon terminals frequently formed symmetric synapses with dendritic shafts and spines of unidentified neurons.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"

        "abstract": [
            "Small extracellular injections of HRP were placed into a stratum of corticocortical axons situated immediately deep to area 3b of the monkey somatic sensory cortex. This stratum had previously been demonstrated to contain corticocortical fibers linking the cytoarchitectonic fields of the somatic sensory cortex to one another and certain of them to the motor cortex. This method resulted in extremely successful filling of pyramidal cells, their axons, collateral axon branches, and terminations in areas 3b, 1, and 2 posterior to the injection and in areas 3a and 4 anterior to it. The major finding was that cells with somata situated in any one of these fields and with principal axons traversing the injection site have long collaterals, primarily in layers III and V, which can extend throughout their own cytoarchitectonic field and into one or more other fields. In these fields they give off focused, columnlike concentrations of terminal boutons, which can be separated from one another by 800 micron or more. The anterogradely labeled, primary corticocortical fibers, traced forwards into areas 3a and 4, have virtually identical focal terminations. These findings indicate that interareal connectivity in the sensory-motor cortex can be effected by the axon branches of single cells rather than by separate groups of cells, and this may form a basis for the convergence of place and modality information on single cells in the sensorimotor cortex, a convergence that is not seen in the thalamic input to this cortex."

        "abstract": [
            "Subpopulations of cortical pyramidal neurons have been distinguished based on the projection target of their principal axons or by their dendritic morphology. In this study, we sought to test the hypothesis that pyramidal neurons in monkey prefrontal cortex that furnish callosal or ipsilateral projections have distinctive dendritic morphologies. Retrogradely-labeled, Fast Blue-containing callosal and ipsilateral neurons were intracellularly filled with Lucifer Yellow, immunoconverted, and reconstructed. Quantitative measurements of the size and complexity of the dendritic arbor, including total dendritic length, horizontal extent, number of branch points, maximum branch order, and number of segments, as well as spine density, were made. In general, callosal neurons had larger and more complex dendritic arbors for both apical and basilar dendritic trees than did ipsilateral neurons. The greatest difference was in total dendritic length; the apical and basilar trees of callosal neurons were 34 and 25% longer, respectively. In addition, spine density was also significantly greater on the apical and basilar dendrites of callosal neurons. These findings could not be explained by differences in somal size or completeness of dendritic filling between callosal and ipsilateral neurons.Our observations support the hypothesis that callosal and ipsilateral neurons differ on a number of measures of dendritic size and complexity. Furthermore, these findings imply that these two subpopulations of pyramidal cells differ in the number and perhaps types of excitatory inputs that they receive. Finally, differences in the dendritic morphology of callosal and ipsilateral neurons have implications for understanding the functional attributes of these two populations of cells, as well as for the characterization of pyramidal neurons in human disease states."

        ], 
        "abstract": [
            "The primate neocortex possesses an extraordinary degree of regional specialization. Virtually all cortical functions are dependent upon a complex system of reciprocal connections between related cortical regions that allow for distributed information processing. Although some aspects of the organization of these corticocortical projections are understood, little is known about the morphology and afferents to the cells of origin of long corticocortical projections in primates. We combined intracellular injection of Lucifer Yellow (LY) in fixed tissue with in vivo retrograde transport of fast blue to study the dendritic morphology of neurons within the inferior temporal gyrus (ITG) and the superior temporal sulcus (STS) that furnish corticocortical projections to the prefrontal cortex. The fast blue retrogradely labeled cells formed two clearly defined bands within the inferior temporal cortex: a supragranular band that corresponded to layer III, and an infragranular band that corresponded to layers V and VI. After Lucifer Yellow intracellular filling, these retrogradely labeled cells projecting to the prefrontal cortex were found to be morphologically very heterogeneous. Although all filled cells had spiny dendrites, they presented a wide range of cell body sizes and dendritic tree morphologies. In layer III, the majority of cells were typical pyramids of various sizes. In layers V-VI, numerous typical pyramidal cells were present. In addition, significant numbers of modified pyramidal forms were found, including vertical and horizontal fusiform cells, asymmetrical pyramids and multipolar cells. The entire dendritic arbor of individual subtypes in layers III, V, and VI was restricted to a few cortical layers, but as a group these cells had dendrites spanning the whole cortical depth. We suggest that corticocortically projecting cells are distinct from subcortically projecting cells and consist of a defined set of morphological and functional subgroups, each of which is driven by a distinct set of afferents and likely possesses different response properties."

            "In area TE of the macaque inferior temporal cortex, horizontal axons running parallel to the pial surface mediate interactions between laterally displaced sites across the cortex. We examined the spatial distribution and the types of cells that give rise to these horizontal axons, which are important factors in determining the nature of the lateral interactions in TE. Intracortical injections of retrograde tracers labeled columnar clusters of cells and cells diffusely scattered within TE. The clusters were 0.35 +/- 0.11 mm (mean +/- SD) in diameter and were laterally distributed up to 6 mm from the injection site. Labeled cells were found in layers 2 to 6, with only a few labeled cells seen in layer 4. The clustering of labeled cells in layers 5 and 6 was looser than that in layers 2 and 3. Intracellular staining of the retrogradely labeled cells revealed that the majority of them were typical or modified pyramidal cells, both within and between the clusters. Only a few nonpyramidal interneurons were also stained at the fringe of the tracer injection site. Consistent with these results, only a small proportion of the retrogradely labeled cells exhibited gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-like immunoreactivity, mostly found within 1 mm from the injection site. The results indicate that direct horizontal interactions in TE are predominantly mediated by pyramidal or modified pyramidal cells in layers 2, 3, 5, and 6 and are primarily excitatory in nature. The contribution of GABAergic interneurons to direct horizontal interactions is restricted to only short-distance projections."

            "The spiny stellate neurons have been studied by the Golgi method in the auditory koniocortex and parakoniocortex of man. Spiny stellate cells are a consistent though not very common component of layer IV. They are not confined to specific sublayers but occur at all depths of layer IV, and also in layer IIIc. Spiny stellate cells in the auditory areas show a great variety of their dendritic arborization pattern. The presence of all intermediate forms between small pyramidal cells--which constitute the dominant cell type in layer IV and which display an extraordinary heteromorphism--and spiny stellate cells shows the close kinship between both neuronal types. The morphology and distribution of spines along the dendrites of spiny stellate neurons are similar to those of the small pyramidal cells of the same layer. The axons, which were impregnated only in their proximal portions, mostly descend, giving rise to recurrent ascending collaterals, but initially ascending axons do also occur. Spiny stellate neurons are present in the different cytoarchitectonic areas examined, and thus they are not confined to the auditory koniocortex."

            "The Golgi Rapid and Kopsch techniques have been used to provide material for an examination of the internal neuronal organization of cortical area VII of the Macaca monkey. The afferent and efferent relationships of area VII, as shown by axoplasmic transport tracing techniques in our own material and in previous studies in other laboratories, are reviewed. Comparison is made between the internal organisation of VI and VII cortex in terms of (1) the marked different in spiny and nonspiny neurons populations of granular layer 4, (2) the difference in relationship of lamina 6 pyramidal neurons to the overlying layers with a shift away from any relationship to granular layer 4 in VII, and (3) differences in the organization of VI lamina 4B and VII lamina 3B--both similarly placed, fiber-rich bands in the two cortical areas. The extrinsic relationships of VI and VII with the lateral geniculate nucleus, superior colliculus, pulvinar, peristriate cortex, cortical area STS, and with each other are compared in terms of laminar locations of efferent neurons and afferent axon terminal fields. It is hoped that this anatomical survey will provide a better foundation for physiological explorations of the region."

            "Intrinsic connections are likely to play important roles in cognitive information processing in the prefrontal association cortex. To gain insight into the organization of these circuits, intracortical connections of major laminar and sublaminar divisions were retrogradely labeled in Walker's area 9 and 46 in rhesus monkeys by using cholera toxin (B-subunit) conjugated to colloidal gold. Microinjections placed within particular cortical laminae produced unique patterns of retrograde labeling. Injections in layers II/III yielded labeling which was laterally widespread (2-7 mm) in supragranular layers, and more narrowly focused, i.e., conforming to a column, in layers IV-VI. In contrast, local circuits associated with layers IV and Vb displayed a regular, cylindrical organization, whereas intrinsic connections of layer Va were laterally extensive (3-5 mm) in layers III and Va. Finally, injections in layer VI gave rise to a narrow column of cell labeling traversing all layers, augmented by laterally extensive labeling (approximately 7 mm) in layer VI. The intrinsic connections of the prefrontal cortex were arrayed within mediolaterally elongated stripes which were often distributed asymmetrically in either the medial or lateral direction. In addition, labeled cells within these mediolaterally oriented fields were frequently grouped within discrete clusters or narrow bands. The intrinsic connections identified in this study differ from the local circuits of corresponding layers reported for primary visual cortex; the unique intrinsic wiring diagram of the prefrontal cortex may be related to its specialized cognitive and mnemonic functions."

            "Both local and long-range connections are critical mediators of information processing in the cerebral cortex, but little is known about the relationships among these types of connections, especially in higher-order cortical regions. We used quantitative reconstructions of the label arising from discrete (approximately 350 microns diameter) injections of biotinylated dextran amine and cholera toxin B to determine the spatial organization of the axon collaterals and principal axon projections furnished by pyramidal neurons in the supragranular layers of monkey prefrontal cortex (areas 9 and 46). Both terminals and cell bodies labeled by transport along axon collaterals in the gray matter formed intrinsic clusters which were arrayed as a series of discontinuous stripes of similar size and shape. The co-registration of anterograde and retrograde transport confirmed that these convergent and divergent intrinsic connections also were reciprocal. Transport from the same injection sites along principal axons through the white matter formed associational clusters which were also arrayed as a series of discontinuous stripes. The dimensions of the anterogradely- and retrogradely-labeled associational stripes were very similar to each other and to the intrinsic stripes. These findings demonstrate that divergence, convergence, and reciprocity characterize both the intrinsic and associational excitatory connections in the prefrontal cortex. These patterns of connections provide an anatomical substrate by which activation of a discrete group of neurons would lead to the recruitment of a specific neuronal network comprised of both local and distant groups of cells. Furthermore, the consistent size of the intrinsic and associational stripes (approximately 275 by 1,800 microns) suggests that they may represent basic functional units in the primate prefrontal cortex."

        "abstract": [
            "A study has been made of the nonpyramidal, local circuit neurons in developing and mature macaque monkey prefrontal cortex with Golgi and immunocytochemical techniques. The area chosen for study is located between the cingulate gyrus and the ventral bank of the principal sulcus, and contains areas 9 and 46 as described by Walker (J. Comp. Neurol. 73:59-86, '40). In Golgi studies, the unique axonal features of impregnated neurons made possible the identification of thirteen separate classes of local circuit neurons. Five of these cell types, in their general characteristics, resembled classes identified in human prefrontal cortex, as well as in other cortical areas of macaque monkeys and other species. Measurements of the scale of axon arbors and dendritic fields of the Golgi-stained local circuit neurons also suggested particular spatial relationships of certain classes to the scale of intrinsic lattice connections made by the axons of pyramidal neurons in the same region. Similarities in morphology between cells described in human prefrontal cortex and neuron varieties described in this study indicate that this region of monkey prefrontal cortex may serve as a useful model for neuron populations in human prefrontal cortex. Sufficient morphological detail was present in immunocytochemical studies to suggest one or more identifying biochemical characteristics for seven of the thirteen classes of local circuit neurons. The calcium binding proteins, parvalbumin, calbindin D-28K, and calretinin, were found in chandelier and wide arbor neurons, neurogliaform cells, and double bouquet neurons, respectively. In addition, cholecystokinin immunoreactivity was present in medium arbor neurons and in narrow arbor cells connecting layers 2 and 4. Somatostatin 28(1-12) immunoreactivity was detected in beaded axon neurons in layers 5 and 6. This biochemical characterization of local circuit neurons, although incomplete, confirms the separate identity of at least some of the varieties distinguished by Golgi morphology, and allows a start to be made on studies examining changes in their functional state. The general inhibitory nature of these interneurons suggests that they are likely to play a crucial role in determining patterns of neural activation in the prefrontal cortex."

        "abstract": [
            "An understanding of the normal organization of prefrontal cortex is essential to the recognition of pathology underlying human behavioral disorders believed to depend on this region. We have therefore studied the pattern of intrinsic intra- and interlaminar pyramidal neuron connectivity in prefrontal areas 9 and 46 (of Walker) in macaque monkey cerebral cortex (anterior to the arcuate sulcus between the principal sulcus and midline). We made focal (200-400 microns) injections of biocytin and mapped the pattern of orthogradely transported label. Injections made into the superficial layers label wide-ranging lateral projections within the same areas of prefrontal cortex. Projections local to such small injections form a narrow band of terminals in layers 1-3 (200-400 microns wide, 2-4 mm long) centered on the injection site. Collateral fibers spread orthogonal to this terminal band, making frequent bifurcations, to establish a series of parallel bands of terminals with uninnervated bands between, spaced regularly across the cortex (center to center 500-600 microns). The entire pattern of terminal label is stripe-like, with occasional narrower interbands and crosslinks between the bands, and can extend over 7-8 mm across the cortex. These projections arise from pyramidal neurons in layers 2, 3, and 5 and terminate in layers 1-3. The stripe-like pattern contrasts with patch-like patterns in other cortical regions (V1, V2, V4, motor, somatosensory) and is smaller in scale than stripe-like zones of corticocortical afferent terminals to this region, reported to be 300-750 microns wide and spaced 1.0-1.5 mm center to center."

        "abstract": [
            "An appreciation of the comparative functions of the corticospinal tract is of direct relevance to the understanding of how results from animal models can advance knowledge of the human motor system and its disorders. Two critical functions of the corticospinal tract are discussed: first, the role of descending projections to the dorsal horn in the control of sensory afferent input, and second, the capacity of direct cortico-motoneuronal projections to support voluntary execution of skilled hand and finger movements. We stress that there are some important differences in corticospinal projections from different cortical regions within a particular species and that these projections support different functions. Therefore, any differences in the organization of corticospinal projections across species may well reflect differences in their functional roles. Such differences most likely reflect features of the sensorimotor behavior that are characteristic of that species. Insights into corticospinal function in different animal models are of direct relevance to understanding the human motor system, providing they are interpreted in relation to the functions they underpin in a given model. Studies in non-human primates will continue to be needed for understanding special features of the human motor system, including feed-forward control of skilled hand movements. These movements are often particularly vulnerable to neurological disease, including stroke, cerebral palsy, movement disorders, spinal injury, and motor neuron disease."

            "The medial nucleus of the pulvinar complex (PM) has widespread connections with association cortex. We investigated the connections of the PM with the prefrontal cortex (PFC) in macaque monkeys, with tracers placed into the PM and the PFC, respectively. Injections of wheat germ agglutinin-horseradish peroxidase (WGA-HRP) placed into the PM resulted in widespread anterograde terminal labeling in layers III and IV, and retrograde cellular labeling in layer VI of the PFC. Injections of tracers centered on the central/lateral PM resulted in labeling of dorsolateral and orbital regions, whereas injections centered on caudal, medial PM resulted in labeling of dorsomedial and medial PFC. Since injections of the PM included neighboring thalamic nuclei, retrograde tracers were placed into distinct cytoarchitectonic regions of the PFC and retrogradely labeled cells in the posterior thalamus were charted. The results of this series of tracer injections confirmed the results of thalamic injections. Injections placed into areas 8a, 12 (lateral and orbital), 45, 46 and 11, retrogradely labeled neurons in the central/lateral PM, while tracer injections placed into areas 9, 12 (lateral), 10 and 24, labeled medial PM. The connections of the PM with temporal, parietal, insular, and cingulate cortices were also examined. The central/lateral PM has reciprocal connections with posterior parietal areas 7a, 7ip, and 7b, insular cortex, caudal superior temporal sulcus (STS), caudal superior temporal gyrus (STG), and posterior cingulate, whereas medial PM is connected mainly with the anterior STS and STG, as well as the cingulate cortex and the amygdala. These connectional studies suggest that the central/ lateral and medial PM have divergent connections which may be the substrate for distinct functional circuits."

        ], 
        "abstract": [
            "By way of introduction, an outline is presented of the origin and evolutionary development of the neocortex. A cortical formation is lacking in amphibians, but a simple three-layered cortex is present throughout the pallium of reptiles. In mammals, two three-layered cortical structures, i.e. the prepiriform cortex and the hippocampus, are separated from each other by a six-layered neocortex. Still small in marsupials and insectivores, this \"new\" structure attains amazing dimensions in anthropoids and cetaceans. Neocortical neurons can be allocated to one of two basic categories: pyramidal and nonpyramidal cells. The pyramidal neurons form the principal elements in neocortical circuitry, accounting for at least 70% of the total neocortical population. The evolutionary development of the pyramidal neurons can be traced from simple, \"extraverted\" neurons in the amphibian pallium, via pyramid-like neurons in the reptilian cortex to the fully developed neocortical elements designated by Cajal as \"psychic cells\". Typical mammalian pyramidal neurons have the following eight features in common: (1) spiny dendrites, (2) a stout radially oriented apical dendrite, forming (3) a terminal bouquet in the most superficial cortical layer, (4) a set of basal dendrites, (5) an axon descending to the subcortical white matter, (6) a number of intracortical axon collaterals, (7) terminals establishing synaptic contacts of the round vesicle/asymmetric variety, and (8) the use of the excitatory aminoacids glutamate and/or aspartate as their neurotransmitter. The pyramidal neurons constitute the sole output and the largest input system of the neocortex. They form the principal targets of the axon collaterals of other pyramidal neurons, as well as of the endings of the main axons of cortico-cortical neurons. Indeed, the pyramidal neurons constitute together a continuous network extending over the entire neocortex, justifying the generalization: the neocortex communicates first and foremost within itself. The typical pyramidal neurons represent the end stage of a progressive evolutionary process. During further development many of these elements have become transformed by reduction into various kinds of atypical or aberrant pyramidal neurons. Interestingly, none of the six morphological characteristics, mentioned above under 1-6, has appeared to be unassailable; pyramidal neurons lacking spines, apical dendrites, long axons and intracortical axon collaterals etc. have all been described. From an evolutionary point of view the typical pyramidal neurons represent not only the principal neocortical elements, but also the source of various excitatory local circuit neurons. The spiny stellate cells, which are abundant in highly specialized primary sensory areas, form a remarkable case in point.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"

            "We used transneuronal transport of neurotropic viruses to examine the topographic organization of circuits linking the cerebellar cortex with the arm area of the primary motor cortex (M1) and with area 46 in dorsolateral prefrontal cortex of monkeys. Retrograde transneuronal transport of the CVS-11 (challenge virus strain 11) strain of rabies virus in cerebello-thalamocortical pathways revealed that the arm area of M1 receives input from Purkinje cells located primarily in lobules IV-VI of the cerebellar cortex. In contrast, transneuronal transport of rabies from area 46 revealed that it receives input from Purkinje cells located primarily in Crus II of the ansiform lobule. Thus, both M1 and area 46 are the targets of output from the cerebellar cortex. However, the output to each area of the cerebral cortex originates from Purkinje cells in different regions of the cerebellar cortex. Anterograde transneuronal transport of the H129 strain of herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV1) revealed that neurons in the arm area of M1 project via the pons to granule cells primarily in lobules IV-VI, whereas neurons in area 46 project to granule cells primarily in Crus II. Together, the findings from rabies and HSV1 experiments indicate that the regions of the cerebellar cortex that receive input from M1 are the same as those that project to M1. Similarly, the regions of the cerebellar cortex that receive input from area 46 are the same as those that project to area 46. Thus, our observations suggest that multiple closed-loop circuits represent a fundamental architectural feature of cerebrocerebellar interactions."

        "abstract": [
            "The nomenclature most commonly applied to the motor-related nuclei of the human thalamus differs substantially from that applied to the thalamus of other primates, from which most knowledge of input-output connections is derived. Knowledge of these connections in the human is a prerequisite for stereotactic neurosurgical approaches designed to alleviate movement disorders by the placement of lesions in specific nuclei. Transfer to humans of connectional information derived from experimental studies in nonhuman primates requires agreement about the equivalence of nuclei in the different species, and dialogue between experimentalists and neurosurgeons would be facilitated by the use of a common nomenclature. In this review, the authors compare the different nomenclatures and review the cyto- and chemoarchitecture of the nuclei in the anterolateral aspect of the ventral nuclear mass in humans and monkeys, suggest which nuclei are equivalent, and propose a common terminology. On this basis, it is possible to identify the nuclei of the human motor thalamus that transfer information from the substantia nigra, globus pallidus, cerebellum, and proprioceptive components of the medial lemniscus to prefrontal, premotor, motor, and somatosensory areas of the cerebral cortex. It also becomes possible to suggest the principal functional systems involved in stereotactically guided thalamotomies and the functional basis of the symptoms observed following ischemic lesions in different parts of the human thalamus."

We used retrograde transneuronal transport of rabies virus to examine subcortical inputs to AIP in the monkey. Virus transport labeled substantial numbers of neurons in the substantia nigra pars reticulata (SNpr), as well as in the dentate nucleus of the cerebellum. The hotspots of labeled neurons in SNpr and in dentate after AIP injections were separate from those created by virus injections into several other parietal or frontal regions. These observations provide the first evidence that a major output nucleus of the basal ganglia, the SNpr, projects to a region of posterior parietal cortex. In addition, our findings provide further support for the concept that posterior parietal cortex is a target of cerebellar output."

To perform this analysis we created an unfolded map of the dentate. Plotting the results from current and prior experiments on this unfolded map revealed important features about the topography of function in the dentate. We found that the projections to the primary motor and premotor areas of the cerebral cortex originated from dorsal portions of the dentate. In contrast, projections to prefrontal and posterior parietal areas of cortex originated from ventral portions of the dentate. Thus the dentate contains anatomically separate and functionally distinct motor and nonmotor domains."

        ], 
        "abstract": [
            "We have used several anatomical tracing techniques to study the organization of the lateral ventromedial thalamic nucleus in the rat, a region that is selectively activated by cutaneous nociceptive inputs from any part of the body. The lateral ventromedial thalamic projections are organized as a widespread dense band covering mainly layer I of the dorsolateral anterior-most aspect of the cortex. This band diminishes progressively as one moves caudally, disappearing completely at 1mm caudal to bregma level. These widespread projections contrast with the circumscribed projections to the deep layers of the primary somatosensory and insular cortices from the adjacent ventral posteromedial and ventroposterior parvicellular thalamic regions, respectively. Injections into the lateral part of the ventromedial thalamic nucleus of an anterograde/retrograde tracer showed that the cortical layer I areas showing the densest projections from this thalamic region also contain the greatest number of retrogradely labeled cells in cortical layers V and VI. The same injections retrogradely labeled numerous cells which were confined to the dorsal subnucleus reticularis dorsalis in an area that contains a concentration of neurons with widespread nociceptive convergence. Finally, the lateral part of the ventromedial thalamic nucleus was also differentially labeled following a topical application of tetramethylrhodamine-labeled dextran on the dorsolateral anterior cortex. These findings suggest that lateral ventromedial thalamic neurons could be part of a spino-reticulo-thalamo-cortical network that allows signals of pain from any part of the body surface to spread across widespread cortical areas."

            "Anatomical methods which depend upon the anterograde axonal transport of isotopically labeled neuronal proteins or the retrograde axonal transport of the enzyme, horseradish peroxidase, have been used to elucidate the relationships between the reticular complex and the dorsal thalamus and cerebral cortex. Injections of tritiated amino acids in the dorsal thalamus or cerebral cortex in rats, cats and monkeys, show that as the bundles of thalamo-cortical and cortico-thalamic fibers joining a particular dorsal thalamic nucleus to its associated area of the cerebral cortex traverse the reticular complex, they each give rise to a dense zone of terminals occupying a sector of the reticular complex which is relatively constant for that dorsal thalamic nucleus and cortical area. However, because of the wide extent of the dendritic fields of the reticular cells and the degree of overlap between the sectors of the complex subtended by adjacent dorsal thalamic nuclei and adjacent cortical areas, it is likely that the reticular complex samples thalamo-cortical and cortico-thalamic activity in a somewhat unspecific manner. Fibers passing to the reticular complex from the intralaminar nuclei of the thalamus appear to be associated with the projection from the intralaminar nuclei to the striatum. Injections of tritiated amino acids in the reticular complex itself and injections of horseradish peroxidase in various other parts of the brain show that the only efferent pathway from the reticular complex terminates in the nuclei of the dorsal thalamus. The reticular complex does not appear to send fibers to other components of the ventral thalamus nor to the cerebral cortex."

            "The corticoclaustral connections in the rat were investigated by means of the method of the retrograde axonal transport of the fluorescent tracer (Fluoro-Gold; FG). The material consisted of 20 adult Wistar rats. The fluorescent tracer was injected into the anterior, middle or posterior parts of the claustrum. The retrogradely labeled neurons were detected in the layer VI of the neocortex. Injections of the tracer into the anterior part of the claustrum resulted in labeling of the neurons in the motor cortex. After administration of the tracer into the middle part of the insular claustrum, labeled neurons were present both in the motor and somatosensory cortices, while the injections of the tracer into its posterior part resulted in labeling of neurons in the visual cortex. Administration of the fluorescent tracer into the insular claustrum of the rat resulted in labeling of the cortical neurons of the corresponding areas of both hemispheres, however, the contralateral projections seem to be less numerous than the ipsilateral. Our results confirm the existence of reciprocal connections of the claustrum with the neocortex and suggest its role in integration and modification of information reaching the neocortex."

            "Claustral and geniculate afferents to area 17 were labeled by anterograde axonal transport of peroxidase-conjugated wheatgerm agglutinin, and examined in the electron microscope. A peroxidase reaction protocol that led to labeling in the form of minute holes in the EM sections was used. Both types of afferents formed type 1 (presumed excitatory) synapses exclusively. In agreement with previous reports the great majority of geniculate afferents to layers 4 and 6 contacted dendritic spines. The claustral afferents to layers 1 and 6 also predominantly contacted spines. In layer 4, however, claustral afferents contacted spines and dendritic shafts about equally. The results suggest a substantial claustral input to smooth-dendrite cells in layer 4, which are thought to be inhibitory in function. This may be the circuit by which the claustrum helps to generate end-stopped cortical receptive fields (Sherk and LeVay, 1983)."

        "abstract": [
            "The claustrum (Cl) is a subcortical structure located in the basolateral telencephalon of the mammalian brain. It has been a subject of inquiry since the mid-nineteenth century. The Cl can be identified in a number of species, and appears as a phylogenetically related nucleus in Insectivores, Prosimians and Marsupials. Ontogenetic investigations have been the subject of much debate over the years. There are three hypotheses for claustral development. To date, the \"hybrid theory\" has garnered the most support. Pathological conditions specifically associated with the Cl, while few in number, are of interest from a functional perspective. Several cases of claustral agenesis have been reported. The implications of these clinical reports are discussed. Claustral neuroanatomy at the light-microscopic and electron-microscopic level is reviewed. The morphology of the claustral neuron consists of several types, which roughly corresponds to the neuron's location within distinct claustral subdivisions. The interconnectivity of the Cl with the cerebral cortex is rather complex and reflective of complex functional interrelationships. Several researchers have investigated the angioarchitecture of the Cl. It appears that vessels permeating the insula also vascularize the Cl. Literature investigating the neurotransmitters and overall chemical neuroanatomy of the Cl is extensive. These studies clearly demonstrate that the Cl is richly innervated with a wide and diverse array of neurotransmitters and neuromodulators. Lesion, stimulation and recording experiments demonstrate that the functional and physiologic capacity of the Cl is quite robust. A recurring theme of claustral function appears to be its involvement in sensorimotor integration. This may be expected of the Cl, given the degree ofheterotopic, heterosensory convergence and its interconnectivity with the key subcortical nuclei and sensory cortical areas. The Cl remains a poorly understood and under investigated nucleus. Therefore, a review of the world literature through 1986 prior to the advent of the \"molecular revolution\" is presented. This diverse and extensive body of knowledge is reviewed in the areas ofphylogeny, ontogeny, pathology, angioarchitecture, cytochemistry, anatomy and physiology. Theories of possible claustral function are also noted. It is hoped that this work will stimulate research scientists to further investigate the functional interrelationships of the Cl as well as to aim with far greater precision and accuracy towards a deeper understanding of its raison d'etre. The recent efforts in neurosciences by Sir Francis Crick and Christof Koch implicating the Cl in visual consciousness, is an important step in understanding just what its functions could encompass. Efforts in molecular neurosciences will be indispensable for a mechanistic understanding of these functions. Currently research efforts are underway from many perspectives. In considering the past scientific literature on the Cl, it is interesting to regard that this once obscure brain structure, may serve as a model system for the study of one of the most interesting and complex brain functions-consciousness."

            "The claustrum is a thin, irregular, sheet-like neuronal structure hidden beneath the inner surface of the neocortex in the general region of the insula. Its function is enigmatic. Its anatomy is quite remarkable in that it receives input from almost all regions of cortex and projects back to almost all regions of cortex. We here briefly summarize what is known about the claustrum, speculate on its possible relationship to the processes that give rise to integrated conscious percepts, propose mechanisms that enable information to travel widely within the claustrum and discuss experiments to address these questions."

        "abstract": [
            "The detailed morphology of long extrinsically projecting axons in the neocortex has been difficult to investigate and is in fact poorly understood. Some data, based on extracellular injections of Phaseolus vulgaris leucoagglutinin (PHA-L), are available for individual axons projecting from area V1 to area V2 or MT. Like geniculocortical projections, axons projecting from area V1 to area MT are readily identifiable (they typically have a bistratified termination pattern and large terminal specializations and are of large caliber), but those projecting from area V1 to V2 are more variable. To provide a broader basis for interpreting constant and variable features of axon morphology, we used high-resolution serial section reconstruction to analyze small populations of PHA-L-labeled axons projecting from area V2 to V4. Reconstruction of 20 axons suggests that this system is variable in terms of overall configuration and laminar distribution. Most terminal arbors are located at the border between layers 3 and 4, but some remain entirely within layer 3 or 4, some target preferentially the superficial layers (1, 2, and 3A), and some have collaterals in layer 5 or, rarely, layer 6. Arbor size is fairly constant among the three visual cortical projections examined so far (typically about 200 microns in diameter). In area V4, however, axons frequently have three or four separate arbors, which branch divergently (in one instance, over 2.6 mm x 3.0 mm). These features may be correlated with aspects of the particular functional organization of area V4, such as coarse topography, large receptive field size, and modularity. Axonal variability may also denote differences, morphological or physiological, among neurons of origin in area V2."

We further explored this model by using quantitative methods to describe the structure and connections of prefrontal cortices. Multi-parameter analyses distinguished different cortical types, positioning at one extreme medial and orbitofrontal (limbic) cortices, and at the other extreme, lateral (eulaminate) cortices. The structural model accurately predicted the laminar pattern of connections, and the relative distribution of connections within cortical layers, based on cortical type. This model may provide the foundation to predict the nature of corticocortical processing and its disruption in psychiatric and neurologic diseases, where neuropathology affects specific types of neurons and layers.\r"

        "abstract": [
            "Lateral prefrontal and intraparietal cortices have strong connectional and functional associations but it is unclear how their common visuomotor, perceptual and working memory functions arise. The hierarchical scheme of cortical processing assumes that prefrontal cortex issues 'feedback' projections to parietal cortex. However, the architectonic heterogeneity of these cortices raises the question of whether distinct areas have laminar-specific interconnections underlying their complex functional relationship. Using quantitative procedures, we showed that laminar-specific connections between distinct prefrontal (areas 46 and 8) and lateral intraparietal (LIPv, LIPd and 7a) areas in Macaca mulatta, studied with neural tracers, varied systematically according to rules determined by the laminar architecture of the linked areas. We found that axons from areas 46 and rostral 8 terminated heavily in layers I-III of all intraparietal areas, as did caudal area 8 to area LIPv, suggesting 'feedback' communication. However, contrary to previous assumptions, axons from caudal area 8 terminated mostly in layers IV-V of LIPd and 7a, suggesting 'feedforward' communication. These laminar patterns of connections were highly correlated with consistent differences in neuronal density between linked areas. When neuronal density in a prefrontal origin was lower than in the intraparietal destination, most terminations were found in layer I with a concomitant decrease in layer IV. The opposite occurred when the prefrontal origin had a higher neuronal density than the target. These findings indicate that the neuronal density of linked areas can reliably predict their laminar connections and may form the basis of understanding the functional complexity of prefrontal-intraparietal interactions in cognition."

        "abstract": [
            "The cytoarchitectonic organization and the structure of layer V neuronal populations in cat primary auditory cortex (AI) were analyzed in Golgi, Nissl, immunocytochemical, and plastic-embedded preparations from mature specimens. The major cell types were characterized as a prelude to identifying their connections with the thalamus, midbrain, and cerebral cortex using axoplasmic transport methods. The goal was to describe the structure and connections of layer V neurons more fully. Layer V has three sublayers based on the types of neuron and their sublaminar projections. Four types of pyramidal and three kinds of nonpyramidal cells were present. Classic pyramidal cells had a long apical dendrite, robust basal arbors, and an axon with both local and corticofugal projections. Only the largest pyramidal cell apical dendrites reached the supragranular layers, and their somata were found mainly in layer Vb. Three types departed from the classic pattern; these were the star, fusiform, and inverted pyramidal neurons. Nonpyramidal cells ranged from large multipolar neurons with radiating dendrites, to Martinotti cells, with smooth dendrites and a primary trunk oriented toward the white matter. Many nonpyramidal cells were multipolar, of which three subtypes (large, medium, and small) were identified; bipolar and other types also were seen. Their axons formed local projections within layer V, often near pyramidal neurons. Several features distinguish layer V from other layers in AI. The largest pyramidal neurons were in layer V. Layer V neuronal diversity aligns it with layer VI (Prieto and Winer [1999] J. Comp. Neurol. 404:332--358), and it is consistent with the many connectional systems in layer V, each of which has specific sublaminar and neuronal origins. The infragranular layers are the source for several parallel descending systems. There were significant differences in somatic size among these projection neurons. This finding implies that diverse corticofugal roles in sensorimotor processing may require a correspondingly wide range of neuronal architecture."

        "abstract": [
            "The functional organization of the cortico-nucleus accumbens-substantia nigra pars reticulata circuit was investigated in the rat using combined anatomical and electrophysiological approaches. The nucleus accumbens neurons which project to the substantia nigra pars reticulata are located in a circumscribed region of the core immediately adjacent and extending dorsally to the anterior commissure. As shown by retrograde and anterograde transports of wheatgerm agglutinin conjugated to horseradish peroxidase, the region of the nucleus accumbens related to the substantia nigra was found to receive bilateral inputs from restricted areas of the medial and lateral prefrontal cortex, i.e., prelimbic/medial orbital and dorsal agranular insular areas. The electrical stimulation of these medial and lateral prefrontal cortical areas induced excitatory responses in nucleus accumbens neurons projecting to the dorsomedial substantia nigra pars reticulata. Interestingly, an important proportion (61%) of the nucleus accumbens-nigral cells responding to the stimulation of the lateral prefrontal cortex were also excited by the stimulation of the medial prefrontal cortex, demonstrating the existence of a convergent influence of these cortical areas on single nucleus accumbens cells. Furthermore, the present data also show that the stimulation of the medial prefrontal cortex results in a powerful inhibition of the tonic firing of the substantia nigra pars reticulata neurons. In conclusion, this study reveals the existence of a functional link between the prefrontal cortex (prelimbic/medial orbital and agranular insular areas) and the nucleus accumbens neurons which innervate the dorsomedial region of the substantia nigra pars reticulata. Since the dorsomedial region of substantia nigra pars reticulata is known to project to subfields of the mediodorsal and ventromedial thalamic nuclei related to the prefrontal cortex, the present data further demonstrate the existence of a prefrontal-nucleus accumbens-thalamo-cortical circuit involving the substantia nigra pars reticulata."

        "abstract": [
            "Connections of layer III pyramidal neurons to corticospinal neurons of layer V and corticothalamic neurons of layer VI in the rat primary motor cortex were examined in brain slices by combining intracellular staining with Golgi-like retrograde labeling of corticofugal neurons. Forty layer III pyramidal neurons stained intracellularly were of the regular-spiking type, showed immunoreactivity for glutaminase, and emitted axon collaterals arborizing locally in layers II/III and/or V. Nine of them were reconstructed for morphologic analysis; 15.2% or 3.8% of varicosities of axon collaterals of the reconstructed neurons were apposed to dendrites of corticospinal or corticothalamic neurons, respectively. By confocal laser scanning and electron microscopy, some of these appositions were revealed to make synapses. These findings suggest that corticospinal neurons receive information from the superficial cortical layers four times more frequently than corticothalamic neurons. The connections were further examined by intracellular recording of excitatory postsynaptic potential (EPSP) that were evoked in layer V and layer VI pyramidal neurons by stimulation of layer II/III. EPSPs evoked in layer V pyramidal neurons showed short and constant onset latencies, suggesting their monosynaptic nature. In contrast, most EPSPs evoked in layer VI pyramidal neurons had long onset latencies, showed double-shock facilitation of onset latency, and were largely suppressed by an N-methyl-D-aspartic acid receptor blocker, suggesting that they were polysynaptic. The results suggest that information from the superficial cortical layers is transferred directly and efficiently to corticospinal neurons in layer V and thereby exerts an important influence on cortical motor output. Corticothalamic neurons are, in contrast, considered relatively independent of, or indirectly related to, information processing of the superficial cortical layers."

        "abstract": [
            "The organization of the thalamostriatal projections arising from the centromedian (CM) and parafascicular (Pf) thalamic nuclei in the squirrel monkey (Saimiri sciureus) was studied at both light and electron microscopic levels. Following selective injections of the anterograde axonal tracer Phaseolus vulgaris-leucoagglutinin (PHA-L) into the CM or Pf, patterns of terminal arborization within the striatum were compared to the biochemical heterogeneity of the striatum as revealed by immunohistochemical staining for the calcium-binding protein calbindin D-28k (CaBP), and histochemical staining for the enzymes acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate-diaphorase (NADPH-diaphorase). The PHA-L-labeled axon terminals within the striatum were further analyzed at the ultrastructural level to characterize their pattern of synaptic organization. Dense and heterogeneous terminal fields occur in the \"sensorimotor\" territory of the striatum after CM injections, or in the \"associative\" striatal territory following Pf injections. In the associative territory labeled axons arborize in a diffuse manner predominantly within areas enriched with CaBP, AChE, or NADPH-diaphorase, representing the matrix compartment, and tend to avoid areas poor in these substances, corresponding to the patch/striosome compartment. In the sensorimotor territory labeled axons form bands that occupy a subregion of the NADPH-diaphorase-rich zone in the putamen. The terminal pattern of the CM-striatal projection suggests the existence of a more complex mosaic organization within the sensorimotor territory. Ultrastructural analysis of PHA-L-labeled elements within the striatum reveals that both CM and Pf projections form asymmetric synapses upon dendrites and spines of striatal cells. A total of 339 PHA-L-labeled boutons were examined after CM injections and compared to 293 boutons following Pf injections. After CM injections, 29% of PHA-L-labeled terminals form synapses on dendritic spines and 66% on dendritic shafts, whereas after Pf injections only 12% of synapses occur on dendritic spines compared to 81% on dendritic shafts. Labeled terminals forming axosomatic or axoaxonic synapses were not seen within the striatum following either CM or Pf injections. It is concluded that in the squirrel monkey: 1) Pf-striatal fibers profusely arborize within the matrix compartment of the associative territory, 2) CM-striatal fibers form bands that occupy a subregion of the NADPH-diaphorase-rich zone within the sensorimotor territory, and 3) that both Pf- and CM-striatal projections establish asymmetric synapses with dendrites and spines of medium-sized spiny cells.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"

            "Although thalamic projections to the dorsal striatum are well described in primates and other species, little is known about thalamic projections to the ventral or \"limbic\" striatum in the primate. This study explores the organization of the thalamic projections to the ventral striatum in the primate brain by means of wheat germ agglutinin conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (WGA-HRP) and Lucifer yellow (LY) retrograde tracer techniques. In addition, because functional and connective differences have been described for the core and shell components of the nucleus accumbens in the rat and are thought to be similar in the primate, this study also explores whether these regions of the nucleus accumbens can be distinguished by their thalamic input. Tracer injections are placed in different portions of the ventral striatum, including the medial and lateral regions of the ventral striatum; the central region of the ventral striatum, including the dorsal part of the core of the nucleus accumbens; and the shell region of the nucleus accumbens. Retrogradely labeled neurons are located mainly in the midline nuclear group (anterior and posterior paraventricular, paratenial, rhomboid, and reuniens thalamic nuclei) and in the parafascicular thalamic nucleus. Additional labeled cells are found in other portions of the intralaminar nuclear group as well as in other thalamic nuclei in the ventral, anterior, medial, lateral, and posterior thalamic nuclear groups. The distribution of labeled cells varies depending on the area of the ventral striatum injected. All regions of the ventral striatum receive strong projections from the midline thalamic nuclei and from the parafascicular nucleus. In addition, the medial region of the ventral striatum receives numerous projections from the central superior lateral nucleus, the magnocellular subdivision of the ventral anterior nucleus, and parts of the mediodorsal nucleus. After injection into the lateral region of the ventral striatum, few labeled neurons are seen scattered in nuclei of the intralaminar and ventral thalamic groups and occasional labeled cells in the mediodorsal nucleus. The central region of the ventral striatum, including the dorsal part of the core of the nucleus accumbens, receives a limited projection from the midline thalamic, predominantly from the rhomboid nucleus. It receives much smaller projections from the central medial nucleus and the ventral, anterior, and medial thalamic groups. The shell of the nucleus accumbens receives the most limited projection from the thalamus and is innervated almost exclusively by the midline thalamic nuclei and the central medial and parafascicular nuclei. The shell is distinguished from the rest of the ventral striatum in that it receives the fewest projections from the ventral, anterior, medial, and lateral thalamic nuclei."

            "We studied the distribution of corticopontine cells in the monkey cerebral cortex. Horseradish peroxidase (HRP) was injected into the brainstem of monkeys in an attempt to fill the pontine nuclei on one or both sides. In control animals we injected the medullary pyramids or varied the route, size, or location of pontine injections. All retrograde filled corticopontine neurons were layer V pyramidal cells. Corticopontine cells were distributed within a largely continuous area of cortex which extended from the cingulate cortex medially to the sylvian fissure laterally; from the superior temporal fissure caudally to the medial part of the frontal granular cortex rostrally. Areas 4 and 6 of Brodmann (1905) contained the highest density of filled cells. In the primary visual cortex, area 17, there were a few labelled cells restricted to the rostral portion of the upper bank of the calcarine fissure, in a region representing the lower periphery of the visual field. The results are discussed in relation to the possible functions of the corticopontine system, especially the role of the extrastriate visual areas in visually guided movement."

        "abstract": [
            "The cytoarchitecture and thalamic afferents of cingulate cortex were evaluated in the rhesus monkey (Macaca mulatta). Area 24 has three divisions of which area 24a is adjacent to the callosal sulcus and has the least laminar differentiation. Area 24b has more clearly defined layers II, III, and Va, and area 24c, which forms the lower bank of the anterior cingulate sulcus, has a particularly dense layer III. Area 23 also has three divisions, each of which has a distinct layer IV. Area 23a is adjacent to the callosal sulcus and has the thinnest layers II-IV, which have the same cell density as layers V and VI. Area 23b has the largest pyramids in layers IIIc and Va, and area 23c, in the depths of the posterior cingulate sulcus, has the broadest external and thinnest internal pyramidal layers. Finally, areas 29 and 30 are located in the posterior depths of the callosal sulcus. Two divisions of area 29 are apparent: one with a granular layer directly adjacent to layer I (area 29a-c) and another with differentiation of layers III and IV (area 29d). Area 30 has a dysgranular layer IV. Injections of the retrograde tracer horseradish peroxidase (HRP) were made into subdivisions of cingulate cortex in the monkey. Area 25 received thalamic input mainly from the midline parataenial (Pt), central densocellular (Cdc), and reuniens nuclei as well as from the dorsal parvicellular division of the mediodorsal nucleus (MDpc). A less dense projection also originated in the intralaminar parafascicular (Pf), central superior, and limitans (Li) nuclei as well as the medial division of the anterior nuclei (AM). Areas 24a and 24b received most thalamic afferents from fusiform and multipolar cells in the Cdc and Pf nuclei with fewer from the ventral anterior (VA) and MDpc and MD densocellular (MDdc) nuclei and only minor input from AM. Most input to premotor cingulate area 24c appeared to originate in VA, MDdc, and Li. Area 29 received the most dense input from nuclei traditionally associated with limbic cortex including the anteroventral (AV), anterodorsal (AD), and laterodorsal (LD) nuclei. Areas 23a and 23b, in contrast, did not receive AV, AD, or LD input, but the greatest proportion of their thalamic afferents arose in AM. Less-pronounced input also came from the lateroposterior (LP), medial pulvinar, and MDdc nuclei.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"

        ], 
        "abstract": [
            "An EM-autoradiographic technique was used to identify the ultrastructural features and synaptic sites of nigral afferents to the ventral anterior nucleus pars magnocellularis (VAmc) of the rhesus monkey thalamus. The findings demonstrate that the nigral boutons are of medium-sized to large, with the majority being of the en passant type. These boutons form symmetric synaptic contacts, and contain pleomorphic or entirely flat vesicles and numerous mitochondria. The nigral input is heavily biased towards thalamocortical projection neurons (PN), whose somata and dendrites represent about 82% of the postsynaptic sites of labeled boutons. The distal dendrites of local circuit neurons (LCN) comprise 13% of the postsynaptic sites. Nigral terminals appear to represent a single extrinsic afferent input to the somata and primary dendrites of thalamocortical projection neurons. A nigral input to LCN somata was not demonstrated but the possibility could not be excluded. Although the basic ultrastructural features of nigral boutons in the monkey are similar to those described earlier in the cat (Kultas-Ilinsky et al.: J. Comp. Neurol. 216:390-405, '83), essential species differences exist in the intensity of the nigral input and its distribution on thalamic neurons."

        "abstract": [
            "The claustrum is interconnected with the frontal lobe, including the motor cortex, prefrontal cortex, and cingulate cortex. The goal of the present study was to assess whether the claustral projections to distinct areas within the frontal cortex arise from separate regions within the claustrum. Multiple injections of tracers were performed in 15 macaque monkeys, aimed toward primary motor area (M1), pre-supplementary motor area (pre-SMA), SMA-proper, rostral (PMd-r) and caudal (PMd-c) parts of the dorsal premotor cortex (PM), rostral (PMv-r) and caudal (PMv-c) parts of the ventral PM, and superior and inferior parts of area 46. The distribution of retrogradely labeled neurons showed no clear segregation along the rostrocaudal axis of the claustrum; they were usually located along the entire anteroposterior extent of the claustrum. For all motor cortical areas, there was a general trend of the labeled neurons to occupy the dorsal and intermediate parts of the claustrum along the dorsoventral axis. The same territories were labeled after injection in area 46, but in addition numerous labeled neurons were found in the most ventral part of the claustrum. At higher resolution, however, there was clear evidence that the territories projecting to pre-SMA and SMA-proper formed separate, interdigitating, clusters along the dorsoventral axis. A comparable local segregation was observed for the two subdivisions of area 46, whereas there was more local overlap among the subareas of PM. The projections from the claustrum to the multiple subareas of the motor cortex and to area 46 arise from largely overlapping territories, with, however, some degree of local segregation."

            "Injections of the anterograde tracer Phaseolus vulgaris-leucoagglutinin within the ventromedial thalamic nucleus resulted in many filled fibres in the frontal areas of rat cerebral cortex. The fibres were restricted to the upper part of layer I except in a small area of motor cortex where terminals were also found in deeper layers. Terminals were also seen in the striatum, in parts of the mesencephalic reticular formation and occasionally in the contralateral ventromedial nucleus. There is some topographical order in the projection with medial and dorsal areas well represented in medial cortex while lateral parts of ventromedial nucleus are more directly related to the cortical area that receives the ventrolateral thalamic nucleus projection. Electron microscopic examination showed the terminals in layer I of cortex making synaptic contact with dendritic spines and small dendritic profiles that showed a very dense postsynaptic specialization. Neurons in the ventromedial nucleus could be antidromically driven from electrode positions along strips of cortex which could not be easily related to any known organizational pattern in the cortex. Thalamic neurons responding antidromically to only one stimulation site were more common when the stimulation was within motor cortical areas, suggesting that in this region a more restricted pattern of termination is the rule."

            "We examined whether light and electron microscopically projection fibers from the globus pallidus (GP) of the cat might terminate on neurons of the thalamic reticular nucleus (RT) sending axons to the centromedian thalamic nucleus (CM). In the first group of experiments, wheat germ agglutinin-conjugated horseradish peroxidase (WGA-HRP) was injected into the GP, and anterogradely labeled preterminal and terminal-like elements were seen in the anterior part of RT. At the anterior pole of RT, these labeled elements were localized in its lateral portion. In the second group of experiments, the retrograde labeling method with WGA-HRP was combined with the degeneration method using kainic acid. In each cat, lesion was placed stereotaxically in the GP by kainic acid injection, and WGA-HRP was then injected into the CM ipsilateral to the kainic acid injection. In the rostral part of RT, a considerable number of degenerated axon terminals deriving from GP were seen to establish synaptic contact with dendritic and somatic profiles, which were retrogradely labeled by WGA-HRP injections in CM. The results indicate that GP innervates directly RT nucleus neurons projecting to CM."

            "This study investigated the organization of the callosal connections of the two subdivisions of the monkey dorsal premotor cortex (PMd), dorso-rostral (F7) and dorso-caudal (F2). In one animal, Fast blue and Diamidino yellow were injected in F7 and F2, respectively; in a second animal, the pattern of injections was reversed. F7 and F2 receive a major callosal input from their homotopic counterpart. The heterotopic connections of F7 originate mainly from F2, with smaller contingent from pre-supplementary motor area (pre-SMA, F6), area 8 (frontal eye fields), and prefrontal cortex (area 46), while those of F2 originate from F7, with smaller contributions from ventral premotor areas (F5, F4), SMA-proper (F3), and primary motor cortex (M1). Callosal cells projecting homotopically are mostly located in layers II-III, those projecting heterotopically occupy layers II-III and V-VI. A spectral analysis was used to characterize the spatial fluctuations of the distribution of callosal neurons, in both F7 and F2, as well as in adjacent cortical areas. The results revealed two main periodic components. The first, in the domain of the low spatial frequencies, corresponds to periodicities of cell density with peak-to-peak distances of approximately 10 mm, and suggests an arrangement of callosal cells in the form of 5-mm wide bands. The second corresponds to periodicities of approximately 2 mm, and probably reflects a 1-mm columnar-like arrangement. Coherency and phase analyses showed that, although similar in their spatial arrangements, callosal cells projecting to dorsal premotor areas are segregated in the tangential cortical domain."

            "In the marmoset (Callithrix jacchus), HRP and 3H-apo-HRP were injected into various cortical regions and the positions of labelled neurons in the non-specific, intralaminar thalamic nuclei (N. centralis and centre m edian ) were investigated. Although neuron populations projecting to the different cortical regions overlap widely, a coarse topology exists inasmuch as intralaminar neurons projecting to the posterior cortex were located more rostrally and those projecting to the anterior cortex were located more caudally in the intralaminar complex. With injections into nearby cortical regions of the parieto-temporal association cortex with HRP and 3H-apo-HRP, respectively, no double labelled cells were found in the intralaminar nuclei, although the fields of labelled cells completely overlapped. Also in the specific projection nuclei no double labelled cells were encountered. About 10-20% of the thalamo-cortical projection cells are located in the intralaminar nuclei. Some functional aspects of this second thalamo-cortical projection system are discussed."

        ], 
        "abstract": [
            "A study was made of the cytoarchitecture of the lateral and medial frontal cortex in the hamadryas baboon (Papio hamadryas). The frontal cortico-cortical connections of areas 46, 8, 6, and 4 were investigated by injection of wheat-germ agglutinine conjugated to horseradish peroxiase (WGA-HRP) into different regions of areas 46, 8, and 6. The lateral region of the frontal lobe of the baboon consists of broad areas of motor (area 4), premotor (area 6), and the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, each of which is further divided into subdivisions with distinct cytoarchitectural features: areas 4a, 4b, 4c; 6 a alpha, 6a beta, 6a gamma, and 6b beta; 8A and 8B; 45; 46 and 46ps; 9; 10; and 12. Although the frontal cortex of the baboon brain exhibits the same basic cytoarchitectural features as the frontal corticies of the cercopithecus (campbelli?) (Vogt and Vogt, '19) or the macaque (Walker, '40; Barbas and Pandya, '87, '89), the baboon frontal cortex is very different from that of the macaque and cercopithecus in terms of cytoarchitecture: (1) the baboon frontal cortex has an additional area, termed here \"6a gamma\", within area 6, which has cytoarchitectural characteristics that are intermediate between those of areas 6 and 8; (2) the aggregation of giant pyramidal cells (greater than 50 microns in diameter) is found only in area 4a in the baboon, whereas such aggregates are found in areas 4a and 4b and, occasionally, in area 4c in the macaque; and (3) area 46 of the prefrontal cortex of the baboon can be subdivided into the cortex that surrounds the principal sulcus (area 46) and the upper and lower banks of the principal sulcus (area 46ps). Retrogradely WGA-HRP labeled cells and anterogradely WGA-HRP labeled terminals coexisted in the frontal cortex in a columnar fashion, indicative of a reciprocity among the connections. The frontal cortico-cortical connections of areas 46, 8, 6, and 4 in the hamadryas baboon were organized as follows: (1) areas 46, 8, and 6 were connected to one another, (2) area 4 was connected only to area 6, and (3) these connections showed a gross ventrodorsal topography: the ventral regions of each of areas 46, 8, and 6 were connected more strongly to the ventral than the dorsal regions of the other areas; the dorsal regions of each of areas 46, 8, and 6 were connected more strongly to the dorsal than the ventral regions of the other areas.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"

        ], 
        "abstract": [
            "Corticopulvinar axons were anterogradely labeled by Phaseolus vulgaris-leucoagglutinin injections in the occipitotemporal cortex of the macaque to determine quantitative parameters of divergence and convergence, arbor size and shape, and distribution of terminal specializations. Forty individual axons were analyzed by serial section reconstruction and divided into two major groups. The majority of axons have numerous (typically 500-1,000) small, spinous endings (boutons terminaux). These axons have terminal fields that are beam-like or elongated (E, corresponding to classical type 1) and highly divergent (1.0-3.0 mm). These frequently innervate several of the traditionally designated pulvinar subdivisions; namely inferior pulvinar (PI) and the ventral part of interal pulvinar (PL); medial pulvinar (PM) and dorsal PL, and (one axon) PM, dorsal PL, and PI. Some axons, however (R or round, corresponding to classical type 2), have a small number (typically 70-160) of primarily large, beaded endings (boutons en passant), which concentrate in sharply delimited, round arbors (diameters 100-125 microns). R axons appear to be larger caliber than E axons (1.0-1.5 microns vs. 0.5-1.0 micron, respectively). These differences in phenotype are probably associated with distinct types of projection neurons. In visual areas, corticopulvinar terminations are reported to originate from pyramidal cell subpopulations in layer 5. Indirect evidence, presented here, suggests that the more numerous medium-sized neurons give rise to E axons, and the sparser giant pyramids give rise to R corticopulvinar axons. If this is correct, corticopulvinar connectivity may be involved in multiple transformations. Spatially, axons of giant neurons (with basal dendrites that collect intracortically from a disc-like area, about 1.0 mm in diameter) converge onto a small number of pulvinar neurons. Axons of medium neurons (with basal dendrites that occupy a small intracortical disc, about 0.3 mm in diameter) diverge over 1.0-3.0 mm in the pulvinar and may form many contacts. Giant neurons, although numerically few in relation to medium pyramids (1 or 2: 50?), are likely to have distinctive membrane properties (functionally equivalent to bursting neurons?). Their larger boutons and axon caliber may be associated with a faster transmission that compensates for their small numbers. In primates, the E and R duality does not characterize cortical projections to the caudate, lateral geniculate nucleus, pons, or superior colliculus and thus may be essentially linked to pulvinar-specific processes."

The neuronal composition of the reticular nucleus of the human thalamus was wider than has previously been described in animals and humans. This nucleus, apart from two types of large, sparsely branched, long-dendrite, reticular, aspiny, neurons, i.e., types R1 and R2, contained cells with spines. Intermediate and small, sparsely-branched, short-dendrite neurons and densely-branched cells with spines were demonstrated. The principles of the organization of the reticular nucleus of the human thalamus are described."

            "The present study used injections of neuroanatomical tracers to determine the subcortical connections of the caudal and rostral subdivisions of the dorsolateral area (DL) and the middle temporal crescent area (MT(C)) in owl monkeys (Aotus trivirgatus), squirrel monkeys (Saimiri sciureus), and macaque monkeys (Macaca fascicularis and M. radiata). Emphasis was on connections with the pulvinar. Patterns of corticopulvinar connections were related to subdivisions of the inferior pulvinar (PI) defined by histochemical or immunocytochemical architecture. Connections of DL/MT(C) were with the PI subdivisions, PICM, PICL, and PIp; the lateral pulvinar (PL); and, more sparsely, the lateral portion of the medial pulvinar (PM). In squirrel monkeys, there was a tendency for caudal DL to have stronger connections with PICL than PICM and for rostral DL/MT(C) to have stronger connections with PICM than PICL. In all three primates, DL/MT(C) had reciprocal connections with the pulvinar and claustrum; received afferents from the locus coeruleus, dorsal raphe, nucleus annularis, central superior nucleus, pontine reticular formation, lateral geniculate nucleus, paracentral nucleus, central medial nucleus, lateral hypothalamus, basal nucleus of the amygdala, and basal nucleus of Meynert/substantia innominata; and sent efferents to the pons, superior colliculus, reticular nucleus, caudate, and putamen. Projections from DL/MT(C) to the nucleus of the optic tract were also observed in squirrel and owl monkeys. Similarities in the subcortical connections of the dorsolateral region, especially those with the pulvinar, provide further support for the conclusion that the DL regions are homologous in the three primate groups."

            "Thalamic relay nuclei transmit basal ganglia output to the frontal cortex, forming the last link in corticobasal ganglia circuitry. The thalamus regulates cortical activity through differential laminar connections, providing not only feedback, but also initiating \"feedforward\" loops, via nonreciprocal projections, that influence higher cortical areas. This study examines the organization of thalamic connections with cortex from basal ganglia relay nuclei, including ventral anterior (VA), ventral lateral (VL), and mediodorsal (MD) nuclei, in the Macaque monkey. Anterograde and bidirectional tracer injections ([3H]-amino acids, dextran conjugates of Fluorescein, Lucifer Yellow or FluoroRuby, or wheat germ agglutinin) into discrete VA/VL, MD, and frontal cortical sites demonstrate specific thalamocortical connections. VL projections target caudal motor areas (primary, supplementary, and caudal premotor areas), whereas VA projections target more rostral premotor areas (including cingulate and presupplementary motor areas) and MD projects to dorsolateral and orbital prefrontal cortices. Thalamocortical projections innervate cortical layers I and III, and to a lesser extent, layer V. In motor areas layer I projections are more extensive than those to layer III (and V). The complex laminar organization of projections from specific thalamic sites suggests differential regulation of cortical function. Injections of bidirectional tracers into thalamic and frontal cortical sites also show that in comparison to thalamocortical projections, corticothalamic projections to VA-VL and MD are more widespread. These findings demonstrate both reciprocal and nonreciprocal components to the thalamo-cortico-thalamic relay. Together, these experiments indicate a dual role for VA-VL and MD nuclei: (1) to relay basal ganglia output within specific cortical circuits and (2) to mediate information flow between cortical circuits."

            "We examined the expression patterns of 4 layer-specific genes in monkey and mouse cortices by fluorescence double in situ hybridization. Based on their coexpression profiles, we were able to distinguish several subpopulations of deep layer neurons. One group was characterized by the expression of ER81 and the lack of Nurr1 mRNAs and mainly localized to layer 5. In monkeys, this neuronal group was further subdivided by 5-HT2C receptor mRNA expression. The 5-HT2C(+)/ER81(+) neurons were located in layer 5B in most cortical areas, but they intruded layer 6 in the primary visual area (V1). Another group of neurons, in monkey layer 6, was characterized by Nurr1 mRNA expression and was further subdivided as Nurr1(+)/connective tissue growth factor (CTGF)(-) and Nurr1(+)/CTGF(+) neurons in layers 6A and 6B, respectively. The Nurr1(+)/CTGF(+) neurons coexpressed ER81 mRNA in monkeys but not in mice. On the basis of tracer injections in 3 monkeys, we found that the Nurr1(+) neurons in layer 6A send some corticocortical, but not corticopulvinar, projections. Although the Nurr1(+)/CTGF(-) neurons were restricted to lateral regions in the mouse cortex, they were present throughout the monkey cortex. Thus, an architectonic heterogeneity across areas and species was revealed for the neuronal subpopulations with distinct gene expression profiles."

            "The cortex receives its major sensory input from the thalamus via thalamocortical axons, and cortical neurons are interconnected in complex networks by corticocortical and callosal axons. Our understanding of the mechanisms generating the circuitry that confers functional properties on cortical neurons and networks, although poor, has been advanced significantly by recent research on the molecular mechanisms of thalamocortical axonal guidance and ordering. Here we review recent advances in knowledge of how thalamocortical axons are guided and how they maintain order during that process. Several studies have shown the importance in this process of guidance molecules including Eph receptors and ephrins, members of the Wnt signalling pathway and members of a novel planar cell polarity pathway. Signalling molecules and transcription factors expressed with graded concentrations across the cortex are important in establishing cortical maps of the topography of sensory surfaces. Neural activity, both spontaneous and evoked, plays a role in refining thalamocortical connections but recent work has indicated that neural activity is less important than was previously thought for the development of some early maps. A strategy used widely in the development of corticocortical and callosal connections is the early overproduction of projections followed by selection after contact with the target structure. Here we discuss recent work in primates indicating that elimination of juvenile projections is not a major mechanism in the development of pathways feeding information forward to higher levels of cortical processing, although its use is common to developing feedback pathways."

For this reason, and in the light of new evidence about the function and evolution of the vertebrate brain, an international consortium of neuroscientists has reconsidered the traditional, 100-year-old terminology that is used to describe the avian cerebrum. Our current understanding of the avian brain - in particular the neocortex-like cognitive functions of the avian pallium - requires a new terminology that better reflects these functions and the homologies between avian and mammalian brains."

            "Sensory stimuli reach the brain via the thalamocortical projection, a group of axons thought to be among the most powerful in the neocortex. Surprisingly, these axons account for only approximately 15% of synapses onto cortical neurons. The thalamocortical pathway might thus achieve its effectiveness via high-efficacy thalamocortical synapses or via amplification within cortical layer 4. In rat somatosensory cortex, we measured in vivo the excitatory postsynaptic potential evoked by a single synaptic connection and found that thalamocortical synapses have low efficacy. Convergent inputs, however, are both numerous and synchronous, and intracortical amplification is not required. Our results suggest a mechanism of cortical activation by which thalamic input alone can drive cortex."

        "abstract": [
            "The corticothalamic system has an important role in synchronizing the activities of thalamic and cortical neurons. Numerically, its synapses dominate the inputs to relay cells and to the gamma-amino butyric acid (GABA)ergic cells of the reticular nucleus (RTN). The capacity of relay neurons to operate in different voltage-dependent functional modes determines that the inputs from the cortex have the capacity directly to excite the relay cells, or indirectly to inhibit them via the RTN, serving to synchronize high- or low-frequency oscillatory activity respectively in the thalamocorticothalamic network. Differences in the alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) subunit composition of receptors at synapses formed by branches of the same corticothalamic axon in the RTN and dorsal thalamus are an important element in the capacity of the cortex to synchronize low-frequency oscillations in the network. Interactions of focused corticothalamic axons arising from layer VI cortical cells and diffuse corticothalamic axons arising from layer V cortical cells, with the specifically projecting core relay cells and diffusely projecting matrix cells of the dorsal thalamus, form a substrate for synchronization of widespread populations of cortical and thalamic cells during high-frequency oscillations that underlie discrete conscious events."

Its simple structure and the form of the weight modification rule used have led to several analyses of two measures of its performance: capacity and information efficiency. However, these have yielded only approximate expressions. In this paper we present a more precise treatment. Simulation results are presented to support the analysis and to deal with the cases where analysis is not possible. We extend previous work which showed that in some cases it may be more efficient (in information theoretic terms) to store many patterns that are each retrieved with a high error rate rather than fewer patterns which are each retrieved with high accuracy."

            "It is well known that for finite-sized networks, one-step retrieval in the autoassociative Willshaw net is a suboptimal way to extract the information stored in the synapses. Iterative retrieval strategies are much better, but have hitherto only had heuristic justification. We show how they emerge naturally from considerations of probabilistic inference under conditions of noisy and partial input and a corrupted weight matrix. We start from the conditional probability distribution over possible patterns for retrieval. We develop two approximate, but tractable, iterative retrieval methods. One performs maximum likelihood inference to find the single most likely pattern, using the conditional probability as a Lyapunov function for retrieval. The second method makes a mean field assumption to optimize a tractable estimate of the full conditional probability distribution. In the absence of storage errors, both models become very similar to the Willshaw model"

            "Computational properties of use to biological organisms or to the construction of computers can emerge as collective properties of systems having a large number of simple equivalent components (or neurons). The physical meaning of content-addressable memory is described by an appropriate phase space flow of the state of a system. A model of such a system is given, based on aspects of neurobiology but readily adapted to integrated circuits. The collective properties of this model produce a content-addressable memory which correctly yields an entire memory from any subpart of sufficient size. The algorithm for the time evolution of the state of the system is based on asynchronous parallel processing. Additional emergent collective properties include some capacity for generalization, familiarity recognition, categorization, error correction, and time sequence retention. The collective properties are only weakly sensitive to details of the modeling or the failure of individual devices."

            "The dynamics of pattern formation is studied for lateral-inhibition type homogeneous neural fields with general connections. Neural fields consisting of single layer are first treated, and it is proved that there are five types of pattern dynamics. The type of the dynamics of a field depends not only on the mutual connections within the field but on the level of homogeneous stimulus given to the field. An example of the dynamics is as follows: A fixed size of localized excitation, once evoked by stimulation, can be retained in the field persistently even after the stimulation vanishes. It moves until it finds the position of the maximum of the input stimulus. Fields consisting of an excitatory and an inhibitory layer are next analyzed. In addition to stationary localized excitation, fields have such pattern dynamics as production of oscillatory waves, travelling waves, active and dual active transients, etc."

Primitive neural models of association and concept-formation are presented, which will elucidate the distributed and multiply superposed manner of retaining knowledge in the brain. The models are subject to two rules of self-organization of synaptic weights, orthogonal and covariance learning. The convergence of self-organization is proved, and the characteristics of these learning rules are shown. The performances, especially the noise immunity, of the association net and concept-formation net are analyzed."

            "We observed robust coupling between the high- and low-frequency bands of ongoing electrical activity in the human brain. In particular, the phase of the low-frequency theta (4 to 8 hertz) rhythm modulates power in the high gamma (80 to 150 hertz) band of the electrocorticogram, with stronger modulation occurring at higher theta amplitudes. Furthermore, different behavioral tasks evoke distinct patterns of theta/high gamma coupling across the cortex. The results indicate that transient coupling between low- and high-frequency brain rhythms coordinates activity in distributed cortical areas, providing a mechanism for effective communication during cognitive processing in humans."

            "Hebbian heteroassociative learning is inherently asymmetric. Storing a forward association, from item A to item B, enables recall of B (given A), but does not permit recall of A (given B). Recurrent networks can solve this problem by associating A to B and B back to A. In these recurrent networks, the forward and backward associations can be differentially weighted to account for asymmetries in recall performance. In the special case of equal strength forward and backward weights, these recurrent networks can be modeled as a single autoassociative network where A and B are two parts of a single, stored pattern. We analyze a general, recurrent neural network model of associative memory and examine its ability to fit a rich set of experimental data on human associative learning. The model fits the data significantly better when the forward and backward storage strengths are highly correlated than when they are less correlated. This network-based analysis of associative learning supports the view that associations between symbolic elements are better conceptualized as a blending of two ideas into a single unit than as separately modifiable forward and backward associations linking representations in memory."

        "abstract": [
            "A model of a neural system where a group of neurons projects to another group of neurons is discussed. We assume that a trace is the simultaneous pattern of individual activities shown by a group of neurons. We assume synaptic interactions add linearly and that synaptic weights (quantitative measure of degree of coupling between two cells) can be coded in a simple but optimal way where changes in synaptic weight are proportional to the product of pre-and postsynaptic activity at a given time. Then it is shown that this simple system is capable of \"memory\" in the sense that it can (1) recognize a previously presented trace and (2) if two traces have been associated in the past (that is, if trace \" height=\"18\" width=\"11\"> was impressed on the first group of neurons and trace \" height=\"15\" width=\"9\"> was impressed on the second group of neurons and synaptic weights coupling the two groups changed according to the above rule) presentation of \" height=\"18\" width=\"11\"> to the first group of neurons gives rise to \" height=\"18\" width=\"11\"> plus a calculable amount of noise at the second set of neurons. This kind of memory is called an \"interactive memory\" since distinct stored traces interact in storage. It is shown that this model can effectively perform many functions. Quantitative expressions are derived for the average signal to noise ratio for recognition and one type of association. The selectivity of the system is discussed. References to physiological data are made where appropriate. A sketch of a model of mammalian cerebral cortex which generates an interactive memory is presented and briefly discussed. We identify a trace with the activity of groups of cortical pyramidal cells. Then it is argued that certain plausible assumptions about the properties of the synapses coupling groups of pyramidal cells lead to the generation of an interactive memory."

            "Stability and encoding properties of two-layer nonlinear feedback neural networks are examined. Bidirectionality is introduced in neural nets to produce two-way associative search for stored associations. The bidirectional associative memory (BAM) is the minimal two-layer nonlinear feedback network. The author proves that every <e1>n</e1>-by- <e1>p</e1> matrix <e1>M</e1> is a bidirectionally stable heteroassociative content-addressable memory for both binary/bipolar and continuous neurons. When the BAM neutrons are activated, the network quickly evolves to a stable state of two-pattern reverberation, or resonance. The stable reverberation corresponds to a system energy local minimum. Heteroassociative information is encoded in a BAM by summing correlation matrices. The BAM storage capacity for reliable recall is roughly <e1>m</e1>&lt;min (<e1>n</e1>,<e1>p</e1>). It is also shown that it is better on average to use bipolar {-1,1} coding than binary {0.1} coding of heteroassociative pairs. BAM encoding and decoding are combined in the adaptive BAM, which extends global bidirectional stability to real-time unsupervised learning"

            "The associative net as a model of biological associative memory is investigated. Calculating the output pattern retrieved from a partially connected associative net presented with noisy input cues involves several computations. This is complicated by variations in the dendritic sums of the output units due to errors in the cue and differences in input activity and unit usage. The possible implementation of these computations by biological neural machinery is unclear. We demonstrate that a relatively simple transformation can reduce variation in the dendritic sums. This leads to a winners-take-all type of strategy that produces increased recall performance which is equivalent to the more complicated optimal strategy proposed by others. We describe in detail the possible biological implications of our strategies, the novel feature of which ascribes a role to the NMDA and non-NMDA channels found in hippocampal pyramidal cells."

            "The associative net is a matrix model of associative memory which has an efficiency of recall approaching that of a random access memory with no associative capability. This is a fully connected network, which makes it possible to use a simple strategy for setting the thresholds of the units in recall. However, most brain structures that are thought to underlie learning and memory have only partial interconnectivity. We describe five different strategies for setting the thresholds of units in partially connected nets. The simplest is a mechanism of the winners-take-all type. The most sophisticated strategy employs information about the density of modified synapses and their distribution on each output unit. The action of this mechanism is shown to be equivalent to minimization of output error but without requiring numerical solution of a set of equations, which would be biologically implausible. Simulation results demonstrate the superiority of this mechanism in a typical case. Parameter sensitivity analysis of this mechanism shows its robustness and that performance improves as connectivity becomes more complete."

        "abstract": [
            "Positron emission tomography imaging of cerebral blood flow was used to localize brain areas involved in the representation of hand grasping movements. Seven normal subjects were scanned under three conditions. In the first, they observed precision grasping of common objects performed by the examiner. In the second, they imagined themselves grasping the objects without actually moving the hand. These two tasks were compared with a control task of object viewing. Grasp observation activated the left rostral superior temporal sulcus, left inferior frontal cortex (area 45), left rostral inferior parietal cortex (area 40), the rostral part of left supplementary motor area (SMA-proper), and the right dorsal premotor cortex. Imagined grasping activated the left inferior frontal (area 44) and middle frontal cortex, left caudal inferior parietal cortex (area 40), a more extensive response in left rostral SMA-proper, and left dorsal premotor cortex. The two conditions activated different areas of the right posterior cerebellar cortex. We propose that the areas active during grasping observation may form a circuit for recognition of hand-object interactions, whereas the areas active during imagined grasping may be a putative human homologue of a circuit for hand grasping movements recently defined in nonhuman primates. The location of responses in SMA-proper confirms the rostrocaudal segregation of this area for imagined and real movement. A similar segregation is also present in the cerebellum, with imagined and observed grasping movements activating different parts of the posterior lobe and real movements activating the anterior lobe."

        "abstract": [
            "Previous studies have reported that some neurons in the inferior temporal (IT) cortex respond selectively to highly specific complex objects. In the present study, we conducted the first systematic survey of the responses of IT neurons to both simple stimuli, such as edges and bars, and highly complex stimuli, such as models of flowers, snakes, hands, and faces. If a neuron responded to any of these stimuli, we attempted to isolate the critical stimulus features underlying the response. We found that many of the responsive neurons responded well to virtually every stimulus tested. The remaining, stimulus-selective cells were often selective along the dimensions of shape, color, or texture of a stimulus, and this selectivity was maintained throughout a large receptive field. Although most IT neurons do not appear to be \"detectors\" for complex objects, we did find a separate population of cells that responded selectively to faces. The responses of these cells were dependent on the configuration of specific face features, and their selectivity was maintained over changes in stimulus size and position. A particularly high incidence of such cells was found deep in the superior temporal sulcus. These results indicate that there may be specialized mechanisms for the analysis of faces in IT cortex. "

            "It takes a fraction of a second to recognize a person or an object even when seen under strikingly different conditions. How such a robust, high-level representation is achieved by neurons in the human brain is still unclear1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. In monkeys, neurons in the upper stages of the ventral visual pathway respond to complex images such as faces and objects and show some degree of invariance to metric properties such as the stimulus size, position and viewing angle2, 4, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12. We have previously shown that neurons in the human medial temporal lobe (MTL) fire selectively to images of faces, animals, objects or scenes13, 14. Here we report on a remarkable subset of MTL neurons that are selectively activated by strikingly different pictures of given individuals, landmarks or objects and in some cases even by letter strings with their names. These results suggest an invariant, sparse and explicit code, which might be important in the transformation of complex visual percepts into long-term and more abstract memories."

        ], 
        "abstract": [
            "In a brain composed of localized but connected specialized areas, disconnection leads to dysfunction. This simple formulation underlay a range of 19th century neurological disorders, referred to collectively as disconnection syndromes. Although disconnectionism fell out of favour with the move against localized brain theories in the early 20th century, in 1965, an American neurologist brought disconnection to the fore once more in a paper entitled, 'Disconnexion syndromes in animals and man'. In what was to become the manifesto of behavioural neurology, Norman Geschwind outlined a pure disconnectionist framework which revolutionized both clinical neurology and the neurosciences in general. For him, disconnection syndromes were higher function deficits that resulted from white matter lesions or lesions of the association cortices, the latter acting as relay stations between primary motor, sensory and limbic areas. From a clinical perspective, the work reawakened interest in single case studies by providing a useful framework for correlating lesion locations with clinical deficits. In the neurosciences, it helped develop contemporary distributed network and connectionist theories of brain function. Geschwind's general disconnectionist paradigm ruled clinical neurology for 20 years but in the late 1980s, with the re-emergence of specialized functional roles for association cortex, the orbit of its remit began to diminish and it became incorporated into more general models of higher dysfunction. By the 1990s, textbooks of neurology were devoting only a few pages to classical disconnection theory. Today, new techniques to study connections in the living human brain allow us, for the first time, to test the classical formulation directly and broaden it beyond disconnections to include disorders of hyperconnectivity. In this review, on the 40th anniversary of Geschwind's publication, we describe the changing fortunes of disconnection theory and adapt the general framework that evolved from it to encompass the entire spectrum of higher function disorders in neurology and psychiatry."

Three major conclusions from recent work are that (i) the capacity for nondeclarative (nonconscious) learning can now be studied in a broad array of tasks that assess classification learning, perceptuomotor skill learning, artificial grammar learning, and prototype abstraction; (ii) cortical areas adjacent to the hippocampal formation, including entorhinal, perirhinal, and parahippocampal cortices, are an essential part of the medial temporal lobe memory system that supports declarative (conscious) memory; and (iii) in humans, bilateral damage limited to the hippocampal formation is nevertheless sufficient to produce severe anterograde amnesia and temporally graded retrograde amnesia covering as much as 25 years."

            "This article has attempted to show how early evidence of the existence of multiple memory systems in the brain arose from the study of a few patients with bilateral damage to the medial structures of the temporal lobe in the hippocampal region, as in the case of the now famous patient HM. Such patients exhibit a profound anterograde amnesia for the experiences of daily life, whereas previously acquired knowledge is well preserved and immediate or primary memory is intact, and other cognitive abilities, including language, perception, and reasoning also are unaffected by the lesion. Despite the seemingly global nature of HM's memory loss, it was possible to show by the appropriate choice of behavioral tasks that many implicit,procedural forms of learning were preserved, and these forms are now known to be mediated by different brain systems. The first major finding was the demonstration of normal acquisition of a motor skill by HM, although he remained unaware that he had done the task before. This finding was followed by the demonstration of preserved perceptual learning,and since then the examples of preserved learning in amnesia have multiplied. In addition, after many false starts, a convincing animal model has now been achieved, with convergent findings for human and nonhuman primates. Although considerable progress has been made since the early 1950s, many questions remain unanswered; particularly, the distinct contributions of the various medial temporal-lobe structures to memory processes and the interaction of these structures with other brain areas need to be clarified. As in the past, the solution of such problems will call for a multidisciplinary approach."

            "Priming is a nonconscious form of human memory, which is concerned with perceptual identification of words and objects and which has only recently been recognized as separate from other forms of memory or memory systems. It is currently under intense experimental scrutiny. Evidence is converging for the proposition that priming is an expression of a perceptual representation system that operates at a pre-semantic level; it emerges early in development, and access to it lacks the kind of flexibility characteristic of other cognitive memory systems. Conceptual priming, however, seems to be based on the operations of semantic memory."

            "Characteristics of an autocorrelation or crosscorrelation associative memory largely depend on how items are encoded in pattern vectors to be stored. When most of the components of encoded patterns to be stored are 0 and only a small ratio of the components are 1, the encoding scheme is said to be sparse. The memory capacity and information capacity of a sparsely encoded associative memory are analyzed in detail, and are proved to be in proportion of n2/logn2, n being the number of neurons, which is very large compared to the ordinary non-sparse encoding scheme of about 0.15n. Moreover, it is proved that the sparsely encoded associative memory has a large basin of attraction around each memorized pattern, when and only when an activity control mechanism is attached to it.

In this article we examine two candidate neural codes: information is represented in the spike rate of neurons, or information is represented in the precise timing of individual spikes. These codes can be distinguished by examining the physiological basis of the highly irregular interspike intervals typically observed in cerebral cortex. Recent advances in our understanding of cortical microcircuitry suggest that the timing of neuronal spikes conveys little, if any, information. The cortex is likely to propagate a noisy rate code through redundant, patchy interconnections."

            "A new hypothesis for the organization of synapses between neurons is proposed: The synapse from neuron x to neuron y is reinforced when x fires provided that no neuron in the vicinity of y is firing stronger than y. By introducing this hypothesis, a new algorithm with which a multilayered neural network is effectively organized can be deduced. A self-organizing multilayered neural network, which is named cognitron, is constructed following this algorithm, and is simulated on a digital computer. Unlike the organization of a usual brain models such as a three-layered perceptron, the self-organization of a cognitron progresses favorably without having a teacher which instructs in all particulars how the individual cells respond. After repetitive presentations of several stimulus patterns, the cognitron is self-organized in such a way that the receptive fields of the cells become relatively larger in a deeper layer. Each cell in the final layer integrates the information from whole parts of the first layer and selectively responds to a specific stimulus pattern or a feature."

            "A neural network model for a mechanism of visual pattern recognition is proposed in this paper. The network is self-organized by learning without a teacher, and acquires an ability to recognize stimulus patterns based on the geometrical similarity (Gestalt) of their shapes without affected by their positions. This network is given a nickname neocognitron. After completion of self-organization, the network has a structure similar to the hierarchy model of the visual nervous system proposed by Hubel and Wiesel. The network consits of an input layer (photoreceptor array) followed by a cascade connection of a number of modular structures, each of which is composed of two layers of cells connected in a cascade. The first layer of each module consists of S-cells, which show characteristics similar to simple cells or lower order hypercomplex cells, and the second layer consists of C-cells similar to complex cells or higher order hypercomplex cells. The afferent synapses to each S-cell have plasticity and are modifiable. The network has an ability of unsupervised learning: We do not need any teacher during the process of self-organization, and it is only needed to present a set of stimulus patterns repeatedly to the input layer of the network. The network has been simulated on a digital computer. After repetitive presentation of a set of stimulus patterns, each stimulus pattern has become to elicit an output only from one of the C-cell of the last layer, and conversely, this C-cell has become selectively responsive only to that stimulus pattern. That is, none of the C-cells of the last layer responds to more than one stimulus pattern. The response of the C-cells of the last layer is not affected by the pattern's position at all. Neither is it affected by a small change in shape nor in size of the stimulus pattern."

            "Brain function relies on specificity of synaptic connectivity patterns among different classes of neurons. Yet, the substrates of specificity in complex neuropil remain largely unknown. We search for imprints of specificity in the layout of axonal and dendritic arbors from the rat neocortex. An analysis of 3D reconstructions of pairs consisting of pyramidal cells (PCs) and GABAergic interneurons (GIs) revealed that the layout of GI axons is specific. This specificity is manifested in a relatively high tortuosity, small branch length of these axons, and correlations of their trajectories with the positions of postsynaptic neuron dendrites. Axons of PCs show no such specificity, usually taking a relatively straight course through neuropil. However, wiring patterns among PCs hold a large potential for circuit remodeling and specificity through growth and retraction of dendritic spines. Our results define distinct class-specific rules in establishing synaptic connectivity, which could be crucial in formulating a canonical cortical circuit. "

            "Changes in synaptic connectivity patterns through the formation and elimination of dendritic spines may contribute to structural plasticity in the brain. We characterize this contribution quantitatively by estimating the number of different synaptic connectivity patterns attainable without major arbor remodeling. This number depends on the ratio of the synapses on a dendrite to the axons that pass within a spine length of that dendrite. We call this ratio the filling fraction and calculate it from geometrical analysis and anatomical data. The filling fraction is 0.26 in mouse neocortex, 0.22\u20130.34 in rat hippocampus. In the macaque visual cortex, the filling fraction increases by a factor of 1.6\u20131.8 from area V1 to areas V2, V4, and 7a. Since the filling fraction is much smaller than 1, spine remodeling can make a large contribution to structural plasticity. "

We studied the population code for shape in area V4 of macaque monkeys, which is part of the ventral (object-related) pathway in primate visual cortex. We have previously found that many macaque V4 neurons are tuned for the curvature and object-centered position of boundary fragments (such as 'concavity on the right'). Here we tested the hypothesis that populations of such cells represent complete shapes as aggregates of boundary fragments. To estimate the population representation of a given shape, we scaled each cell's tuning peak by its response to that shape, summed across cells and smoothed. The resulting population response surface contained 3\u22128 peaks that represented major boundary features and could be used to reconstruct (approximately) the original shape. This exemplifies how a multi-peaked neural population response can represent a complex stimulus in terms of its constituent elements."

        "abstract": [
            "The performances of patients with dementia of the Alzheimer type (DAT), patients with Huntington's disease (HD), and demented and nondemented patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) were compared on 2 tests of implicit memory that do not require the conscious recollection of prior study episodes: (1) a pursuit-rotor motor learning task and (2) a lexical priming test. The HD patients were found to be impaired on the motor learning but not the lexical priming task, whereas the DAT patients evidenced the opposite relationship on these tasks. The demented, but not the nondemented, PD patients were found to be impaired on both tests of implicit memory. For both the HD and PD patients, deficits on the motor learning task correlated significantly with severity of dementia but not with level of primary motor dysfunction. The noted double dissociation between HD and DAT patients indicates that different forms of implicit memory, all of which are intact in amnesia, are dependent upon distinct neuroanatomic systems. Motor skill learning may be mediated by a corticostriatal system, whereas verbal priming may depend upon the integrity of the neocortical association areas involved in the storage of semantic knowledge. The results for the PD patients suggest that the demented PD patients have endured damage to the neurologic systems subserving both motor learning and lexical priming. "

            "The fact that information acquired before the onset of amnesia can be lost (retrograde amnesia) has fascinated psychologists, biologists, and clinicians for over 100 years. Studies of retrograde amnesia have led to the concept of memory consolidation, whereby medial temporal lobe structures direct the gradual establishment of memory representations in neocortex. Recent theoretical accounts have inspired a simple neural network model that produces behavior consistent with experimental data and makes these ideas about memory consolidation more concrete. Recent physiological and anatomical findings provide important information about how memory consolidation might actually occur."

            "Declarative memory enables conscious recollection of the past and has been proposed to be distinct from priming, a perceptual form of memory that operates nonconsciously and improves the ability to detect or identify recently presented stimuli. Yet, it has been difficult to obtain unambiguous evidence for the independence of declarative memory and priming. The authors report the first demonstration, using matched tests, of fully intact perceptual memory (priming) in a profoundly amnesic patient (E.P.), despite at-chance recognition memory. The priming and recognition tests included tests that were matched with respect to test materials, length of the study and test lists, and the kind of cues available at test. Priming appears to reflect neural changes within perceptual processing systems that occur before information reaches the brain systems that transform visual perception into conscious visual memory."

            "An analysis is provided of three distinct paradigms that have been used to study executive functions of the prefrontal cortex involving planning, self-ordered memory or attentional set-shifting. Psychological and anatomical dissociations are sought from the perspective of studies of patients with frontal lobe lesions, functional neuroimaging, psychometric studies in normal volunteers and experimental studies in non-human primates. Particular attention is paid to attempts to dissociate mnemonic from other executive capacities. Thus, patients with frontal damage are shown to have deficits in their (1) use of strategies to improve performance in a spatial working memory task and (2) capacity to make an extra-dimensional shift due to a high-order failure of inhibition in an attentional set-shifting paradigm. These results are discussed in terms of anatomical and neuropharmacological dissociations of different aspects of executive function within the prefrontal cortex shown in monkeys."

            "In a previous paper, a model was presented showing how the group of Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II molecules contained within a postsynaptic density could stably store a graded synaptic weight. This paper completes the model by showing how bidirectional control of synaptic weight could be achieved. It is proposed that the quantitative level of the activity-dependent rise in postsynaptic Ca2+ determines whether the synaptic weight will increase or decrease. It is further proposed that reduction of synaptic weight is governed by protein phosphatase 1, an enzyme indirectly controlled by Ca2+ through reactions involving phosphatase inhibitor 1, cAMP-dependent protein kinase, calcineurin, and adenylate cyclase. Modeling of this biochemical system shows that it can function as an analog computer that can store a synaptic weight and modify it in accord with the Hebb and anti-Hebb learning rules."

        ], 
        "abstract": [
            "The recent reawakened interest in 'neural' networks begs the question of their relevance to the analysis of real nervous systems. Network models have been criticized for the lack of realism of their individual components, and because the architectures required by some neural-network algorithms do not seem to exist in real nervous systems. In three related papers published in the 1970s, David Marr proposed that the cerebellum, the neocortex and the hippocampus each acts as a memorizing device. These theories were intended to satisfy the biological constraints, but in computational terms they are undetermined. In this paper we reassess Marr's theory of the hippocampus as a temporary memory store. We give a complete computational account of the theory and we show that Marr's computational arguments do not sufficiently constrain his choice of model. We discuss Marr's specific model of temporary memory with reference to the neurophysiology and neuroanatomy of the mammalian hippocampus. Our analysis is supported by simulation studies done on various memory models built according to the principles advocated by Marr."

            "During working memory tasks, the firing rates of single neurons recorded in behaving monkeys remain elevated without external cues. Modeling studies have explored different mechanisms that could underlie this selective persistent activity, including recurrent excitation within cell assemblies, synfire chains and single-cell bistability. The models show how sustained activity can be stable in the presence of noise and distractors, how different synaptic and voltage-gated conductances contribute to persistent activity, how neuromodulation could influence its robustness, how completely novel items could be maintained, and how continuous attractor states might be achieved. More work is needed to address the full repertoire of neural dynamics observed during working memory tasks."

        ], 
        "abstract": [
            "A little over 20 years ago, (Teyler and DiScenna,1986; Behav Neurosci 100:147-152) proposed the hippocampal memory index theory. It offered an account of episodic memory based on the intrinsic organization of the hippocampus, its synaptic physiology and its anatomical relationship to other regions of the brain. The essence of their idea was that the hippocampus was functionally designed and anatomically situated to capture information about neocortical activity generated by the individual features of behavioral episode. Moreover, because the hippocampus projects back to these neocortical regions the information it stored could serve as an index to the pattern of neocortical activity produced by the episode. Consequently, a partial cue that activated the index could activate the neocortical patterns and thus retrieve the memory of the episode. In this article we revisit and update indexing theory. Our conclusion is that it has aged very well. Its core ideas can be seen in many contemporary theories and there is a wealth of data that support this conceptual framework."

            "Some forms of memory have been shown to depend on a system of medial temporal lobe structures that includes the hippocampus and the adjacent cortical areas (entorhinal, perirhinal, and parahippocampal cortex). The role of this system is only temporary, however, as indicated by the fact that, after damage to the medial temporal lobe, recent memories are impaired but very remote memories are intact. Here we review the evidence that the medial temporal lobe memory system is involved in a process of consolidation: memories are initially dependent on this system but gradually become established in other areas of the brain. We then review some of the ideas that have been proposed about the phenomenon of consolidation and suggest a synthesis of these views. Finally, we describe a simple neural network model that captures some key features of consolidation."

            "Pyramidal neurons are the principal neurons of the neocortex and their excitatory impact on other pyramidal neurons and interneurons is central to neocortical dynamics. A fundamental principal that has emerged which governs pyramidal neuron excitation of other neurons in the local circuitry of neocortical columns is differential anatomical and physiological properties of the synaptic innervation via the same axon depending on the type of neuron targeted. In this study we derive anatomical principles for divergent innervation of pyramidal neurons of the same type within the local microcircuit. We also review data providing circumstantial and direct evidence for differential synaptic transmission via the same axon from neocortical pyramidal neurons and derive some principles for differential synaptic innervation of pyramidal neurons of the same type, of pyramidal neurons and interneurons and of different types of interneurons. We conclude that differential anatomical and physiological differentiation is a fundamental property of glutamatergic axons of pyramidal neurons in the neocortex."

            "Working memory involves the temporary storage and manipulation of information that is assumed to be necessary for a wide range of complex cognitive activities. In 1974, Baddeley and Hitch proposed that it could be divided into three subsystems, one concerned with verbal and acoustic information, the phonological loop, a second, the visuospatial sketchpad providing its visual equivalent, while both are dependent upon a third attentionally-limited control system, the central executive. A fourth subsystem, the episodic buffer, has recently been proposed. These are described in turn, with particular reference to implications for both the normal processing of language, and its potential disorders.The reader will be introduced to the concept of a multi-component working memory. Particular emphasis will be placed on the phonological loop component, and (a) its fractionation into a storage and processing component, (b) the neuropsychological evidence for this distinction, and (c) its implication for both native and second language learning. This will be followed by (d) a brief overview of the visuospatial sketchpad and its possible role in language, culminating in (e) discussion of the higher-level control functions of working memory which include (f) the central executive and its multi-dimensional storage system, the episodic buffer. An attempt throughout is made to link the model to its role in both normal and disordered language functions."

            "The hippocampal formation (comprising the hippocampus proper, the dentate gyrus, and the subiculum) has been repeatedly implicated in information storage models of the mammalian brain. The precise nature of the hippocampal role in the storage of information has, however, remained elusive. Here it is proposed that the role of the hippocampus is to form and retain an index of neocortical areas activated by experiential events. The hippocampal index, thus, represents those unique cortical regions activated by specific events. The neuronal mechanism underlying the memory index is hypothesized to be long-term potentiation. It is asserted that the reactivation of the stored hippocampal memory index will serve to also reactivate the associated unique array of neocortical areas and thus will result in a memorial experience. This hippocampal reactivation of a neocortical array may also be involved in establishing a cortically based memory trace."

            "This chapter recounts efforts to dissect the cellular and circuit basis of a memory system in the primate cortex with the goal of extending the insights gained from the study of normal brain organization in animal models to an understanding of human cognition and related memory disorders. Primates and humans have developed an extraordinary capacity to process information \"on line,\" a capacity that is widely considered to underlay comprehension, thinking, and so-called executive functions. Understanding the interactions between the major cellular constituents of cortical circuits-pyramidal and nonpyramidal cells-is considered a necessary step in unraveling the cellular mechanisms subserving working memory mechanisms and, ultimately, cognitive processes. Evidence from a variety of sources is accumulating to indicate that dopamine has a major role in regulating the excitability of the cortical circuitry upon which the working memory function of prefrontal cortex depends. Here, I describe several direct and indirect intercellular mechanisms for modulating working memory function in prefrontal cortex based on the localization of dopamine receptors on the distal dendrites and spines of pyramidal cells and on interneurons in the prefrontal cortex. Interactions between monoamines and a compromised cortical circuitry may hold the key to understanding the variety of memory disorders associated with aging and disease."

        ], 
        "abstract": [
            "Studies on the cellular mechanisms of working memory demonstrated that neurons in dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dPFC) exhibit directionally tuned activity during an oculomotor delayed response. To determine the particular contributions of pyramidal cells and interneurons to spatial tuning in dPFC, we examined both individually and in pairs the tuning properties of regular-spiking (RS) and fast-spiking (FS) units that represent putative pyramidal cells and interneurons, respectively. Our main finding is that FS units possess spatially tuned sensory, motor, and delay activity (i. e., \"memory fields\") similar to those found in RS units. Furthermore, when recorded simultaneously at the same site, the majority of neighboring neurons, whether FS or RS, displayed isodirectional tuning, i.e., they shared very similar tuning angles for the sensory and delay phases of the task. As the trial entered the response phase of the task, many FS units shifted their direction of tuning and became cross-directional to adjacent RS units by the end of the trial. These results establish that a large part of inhibition in prefrontal cortex is spatially oriented rather than being untuned and simply regulating the threshold response of pyramidal cell output. Moreover, the isodirectional tuning between adjacent neurons supports a functional microcolumnar organization in dPFC for spatial memory fields similar to that found in other areas of cortex for sensory receptive fields."

        "abstract": [
            "Single-neuron recordings from behaving primates have established a link between working memory processes and information-specific neuronal persistent activity in the prefrontal cortex. Using a network model endowed with a columnar architecture and based on the physiological properties of cortical neurons and synapses, we have examined the synaptic mechanisms of selective persistent activity underlying spatial working memory in the prefrontal cortex. Our model reproduces the phenomenology of the oculomotor delayed-response experiment of Funahashi et al. (S. Funahashi, C.J. Bruce and P.S. Goldman-Rakic, Mnemonic coding of visual space in the monkey's dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. J Neurophysiol 61:331-349, 1989). To observe stable spontaneous and persistent activity, we find that recurrent synaptic excitation should be primarily mediated by NMDA receptors, and that overall recurrent synaptic interactions should be dominated by inhibition. Isodirectional tuning of adjacent pyramidal cells and interneurons can be accounted for by a structured pyramid-to-interneuron connectivity. Robust memory storage against random drift of the tuned persistent activity and against distractors (intervening stimuli during the delay period) may be enhanced by neuromodulation of recurrent synapses. Experimentally testable predictions concerning the neural basis of working memory are discussed."

            "Stimulus-specific persistent neural activity is the neural process underlying active (working) memory. Since its discovery 30 years ago, mnemonic activity has been hypothesized to be sustained by synaptic reverberation in a recurrent circuit. Recently, experimental and modeling work has begun to test the reverberation hypothesis at the cellular level. Moreover, theory has been developed to describe memory storage of an analog stimulus (such as spatial location or eye position), in terms of continuous 'bump attractors' and 'line attractors'. This review summarizes new studies, and discusses insights and predictions from biophysically based models. The stability of a working memory network is recognized as a serious problem; stability can be achieved if reverberation is largely mediated by NMDA receptors at recurrent synapses."

        ], 
        "abstract": [
            "Experimental evidence suggests that the maintenance of an item in working memory is achieved through persistent activity in selective neural assemblies of the cortex. To understand the mechanisms underlying this phenomenon, it is essential to investigate how persistent activity is affected by external inputs or neuromodulation. We have addressed these questions using a recurrent network model of object working memory. Recurrence is dominated by inhibition, although persistent activity is generated through recurrent excitation in small subsets of excitatory neurons.Our main findings are as follows. (1) Because of the strong feedback inhibition, persistent activity shows an inverted U shape as a function of increased external drive to the network. (2) A transient external excitation can switch off a network from a selective persistent state to its spontaneous state. (3) The maintenance of the sample stimulus in working memory is not affected by intervening stimuli (distractors) during the delay period, provided the stimulation intensity is not large. On the other hand, if stimulation intensity is large enough, distractors disrupt sample-related persistent activity, and the network is able to maintain a memory only of the last shown stimulus. (4) A concerted modulation of GABA(A) and NMDA conductances leads to a decrease of spontaneous activity but an increase of persistent activity; the enhanced signal-to-noise ratio is shown to increase the resistance of the network to distractors. (5) Two mechanisms are identified that produce an inverted U shaped dependence of persistent activity on modulation. The present study therefore points to several mechanisms that enhance the signal-to-noise ratio in working memory states. These mechanisms could be implemented in the prefrontal cortex by dopaminergic projections from the midbrain."

            "The neurotrophin hypothesis proposes that neurotrophins participate in activity-induced modification of synaptic transmission. Increasingly, evidence indicates that the synthesis, secretion and actions of neurotrophins on synaptic transmission are regulated by electrical activity and that neurotrophins themselves can acutely modify synaptic efficacy. Neurotrophins appear to exert either a permissive or instructive role on activity-dependent synaptic potentiation and depression, which depends on the particular synaptic connections and developmental stages. The characteristics of synaptic changes that are induced by neurotrophins suggest that this family of proteins is crucial for providing a molecular background in which activity-dependent plasticity can occur at selective synaptic sites within the neural network."

            "Cortical neurons in the waking brain fire highly irregular, seemingly random, spike trains in response to constant sensory stimulation, whereas in vitro they fire regularly in response to constant current injection. To test whether, as has been suggested, this high in vivo variability could be due to the postsynaptic currents generated by independent synaptic inputs, we injected synthetic synaptic current into neocortical neurons in brain slices. We report that independent inputs cannot account for this high variability, but this variability can be explained by a simple alternative model of the synaptic drive in which inputs arrive synchronously. Our results suggest that synchrony may be important in the neural code by providing a means for encoding signals with high temporal fidelity over a population of neurons."

Inhibition and excitation peak with the total neuron conductance during the depolarizing waves of scratch episodes. Furthermore, spike activity is driven by depolarizing synaptic transients rather than pacemaker properties. These findings show that balanced excitation and inhibition and irregular firing are fundamental motifs in certain spinal network functions."

            "Neurons in the cortex of behaving animals show temporally irregular spiking patterns. The origin of this irregularity and its implications for neural processing are unknown. The hypothesis that the temporal variability in the firing of a neuron results from an approximate balance between its excitatory and inhibitory inputs was investigated theoretically. Such a balance emerges naturally in large networks of excitatory and inhibitory neuronal populations that are sparsely connected by relatively strong synapses. The resulting state is characterized by strongly chaotic dynamics, even when the external inputs to the network are constant in time. Such a network exhibits a linear response, despite the highly nonlinear dynamics of single neurons, and reacts to changing external stimuli on time scales much smaller than the integration time constant of a single neuron."

        ], 
        "abstract": [
            "Cortical neurons exhibit tremendous variability in the number and temporal distribution of spikes in their discharge patterns. Furthermore, this variability appears to be conserved over large regions of the cerebral cortex, suggesting that it is neither reduced nor expanded from stage to stage within a processing pathway. To investigate the principles underlying such statistical homogeneity, we have analyzed a model of synaptic integration incorporating a highly simplified integrate and fire mechanism with decay. We analyzed a \"high-input regime\" in which neurons receive hundreds of excitatory synaptic inputs during each interspike interval. To produce a graded response in this regime, the neuron must balance excitation with inhibition. We find that a simple integrate and fire mechanism with balanced excitation and inhibition produces a highly variable interspike interval, consistent with experimental data. Detailed information about the temporal pattern of synaptic inputs cannot be recovered from the pattern of output spikes, and we infer that cortical neurons are unlikely to transmit information in the temporal pattern of spike discharge. Rather, we suggest that quantities are represented as rate codes in ensembles of 50-100 neurons. These column-like ensembles tolerate large fractions of common synaptic input and yet covary only weakly in their spike discharge. We find that an ensemble of 100 neurons provides a reliable estimate of rate in just one interspike interval (10-50 msec). Finally, we derived an expression for the variance of the neural spike count that leads to a stable propagation of signal and noise in networks of neurons-that is, conditions that do not impose an accumulation or diminution of noise. The solution implies that single neurons perform simple algebra resembling averaging, and that more sophisticated computations arise by virtue of the anatomical convergence of novel combinations of inputs to the cortical column from external sources."

            "In layer 4 of cat visual cortex, the monocular, concentric receptive fields of thalamic neurons, which relay retinal input to the cortex, are transformed into 'simple' cortical receptive fields that are binocular and selective for the precise orientation, direction of motion, and size of the visual stimulus. These properties are thought to arise from the pattern of connections from thalamic neurons, although anatomical studies show that most excitatory inputs to layer 4 simple cells are from recurrently connected circuits of cortical neurons. We examined single fibre inputs to spiny stellate neurons. We examined single fibre inputs to spiny stellate neurons in slices of cat visual cortex, and conclude that thalamocortical synapses are powerful and the responses they evoke are unusually invariant for central synapses. However, the responses to intracortical inputs, although less invariant, are strong enough to provide most of the excitation to simple cells in vivo. Our results suggest that the recurrent excitatory circuits of cortex may amplify the initial feedforward thalamic signal, subserving dynamic modifications of the functional properties of cortical neurons."

            "The classical view of neural coding has emphasized the importance of information carried by the rate at which neurons discharge action potentials. More recent proposals that information may be carried by precise spike timing have been challenged by the assumption that these neurons operate in a noisy fashion--presumably reflecting fluctuations in synaptic input and, thus, incapable of transmitting signals with millisecond fidelity. Here we show that precisely synchronized action potentials can propagate within a model of cortical network activity that recapitulates many of the features of biological systems. An attractor, yielding a stable spiking precision in the (sub)millisecond range, governs the dynamics of synchronization. Our results indicate that a combinatorial neural code, based on rapid associations of groups of neurons co-ordinating their activity at the single spike level, is possible within a cortical-like network."

        ], 
        "abstract": [
            "Traditionally, most basal forebrain (BF) functions have been attributed to its cholinergic neurons. However, the majority of cortical-projecting BF neurons are noncholinergic and their in vivo functions remain unclear. We investigated how BF modulates cortical dynamics by simultaneously recording </=50 BF single neurons along with local field potentials (LFPs) from the prefrontal cortex (PFCx) in different wake-sleep states of adult rats. Using stereotypical spike time correlations, we identified a large (roughly 70%) subset of BF neurons, which we named BF tonic neurons (BFTNs). BFTNs fired tonically at 2-8 Hz without significantly changing their average firing rate across wake-sleep states. As such, these cannot be classified as cholinergic neurons. BFTNs substantially increased the spiking variability during waking and rapid-eye-movement sleep, by exhibiting frequent spike bursts with <50-ms interspike interval. Spike bursts among BFTNs were highly correlated, leading to transient population synchronization events of BFTN ensembles that lasted on average 160 ms. Most importantly, BFTN synchronization occurred preferentially just before the troughs of PFCx LFP oscillations, which reflect increased cortical activity. Furthermore, BFTN synchronization was accompanied by transient increases in prefrontal cortex gamma oscillations. These results suggest that synchronization of BFTN ensembles, which are likely to be formed by cortical-projecting GABAergic neurons from the BF, could be primarily responsible for fast cortical modulations to provide transient amplification of cortical activity."

The effects of specific basal forebrain cholinergic lesions upon cortical reorganization associated with learning a skilled motor task were investigated, addressing, for the first time, the functional consequences of blocking cortical map plasticity. Results demonstrate that disrupting basal forebrain cholinergic function disrupts cortical map reorganization and impairs motor learning. Cholinergic lesions do not impair associative fear learning or overall sensorimotor function. These results support the hypothesis that the basal forebrain cholinergic system may be specifically implicated in forms of learning requiring plasticity of cortical representations."

The selectivity of these neurons was quantified with a novel measure. About four spikes per neuron, triggered between 300 and 600 ms after image onset in a handful of units (7.8 on average), predicted the identity of images far above chance. Decoding performance increased linearly with the number of units considered, peaked between 400 and 500 ms, did not improve when considering correlations among simultaneously recorded units, and generalized to very different images. The feasibility of decoding sensory information from human extracellular recordings has implications for the development of brain-machine interfaces."

        "abstract": [
            "We investigated the topographic and laminar organization of the efferent cortical projections of the perirhinal and parahippocampal cortices. Area 36 of the perirhinal cortex projects preferentially to areas TE and TEO, whereas area TF of the parahippocampal cortex projects preferentially to the posterior parietal cortex and area V4. Area TF projects to many regions of the frontal lobe, whereas area 36 projects mainly to the orbital surface. The insular and cingulate cortices receive projections from areas 36 and TF, whereas only area TF projects to the retrosplenial cortex. Projections to the superior temporal gyrus, including the dorsal bank of the superior temporal sulcus, arise predominantly from area TF. Area 36 projects only to rostral levels of the superior temporal gyrus. Area TF has, in general, reciprocal connections with the neocortex, whereas area 36 has more asymmetric connections. Area 36, for example, projects to more restricted regions of the frontal cortex and superior temporal sulcus than it receives inputs from. In contrast, it projects to larger portions of areas TE and TEO than it receives inputs from. The efferent projections of areas 36 and TF are primarily directed to the superficial layers of the neocortex, a laminar organization consistent with connections of the feedback type. Projections to unimodal visual areas terminate in large expanses of the cortex, but predominantly in layer I. Projections to other sensory and polymodal areas, in contrast, terminate in a columnar manner predominantly in layers II and III. In all areas receiving heavy projections, the projections extend throughout most cortical layers, largely avoiding layer IV. We discuss these findings in relation to current theories of memory consolidation."

        "abstract": [
            "The special areal and laminar distributions of cortical afferent connections from various thalamic nuclei in the monkey (Macaca fuscata) were studied by using the anterograde axonal transport technique of autoradiography. The following findings were obtained. The superficial thalamocortical (T-C) projections, terminating in the (superficial half of) cortical layer I, arise mainly from the nucleus ventralis anterior, pars principalis (VApc) and nucleus ventralis lateralis, pars oralis (VLo), and possibly from the nucleus ventralis lateralis, pars medialis (VLm) and nucleus ventralis anterior, pars magnocellularis (VAmc). The VApc gives rise to the superficial T-C and deep T-C projections onto the postarcuate premotor area around the arcuate genu and spur, and onto the dorsomedial part of the caudal premotor area as well as the supplementary motor area (SMA). The VApc also gives rise to only deep T-C projections onto the remaining premotor area and onto the rostral bank of the arcuate sulcus as well as the ventral bank of the cingulate sulcus at the level of the premotor area. The VLo gives rise to the superficial T-C projections onto the ventrolateral part of the motor area (mainly to the forelimb motor area) and onto the dorsomedial part to the mesial cortex at the rostral level of the motor area. The VAmc gives rise to the superficial T-C projections onto the banks of the arcuate genu and adjacent region of area 8. Area X, the nucleus ventralis posterolateralis, pars oralis (VPLo), nucleus ventralis posterolateralis, pars caudalis (VPLc), nucleus ventralis posteromedialis (VPM) and possibly the nucleus ventralis lateralis, pars caudalis (VLc) send only deep T-C projections. The dorsal and medial parts of the VLc project onto the premotor area, the rostral part of the motor area and the SMA, and also the ventral bank of the cingulate sulcus. Area X projects onto the premotor area, the SMA, and the caudal part of area 8. The thalamic relay nuclei projecting onto the frontal association cortex were found to be the VAmc, medial VLc and area X."

            "While sequencing of the human genome surprised us with how many protein-coding genes there are, it did not fundamentally change our perspective on what a gene is. In contrast, the complex patterns of dispersed regulation and pervasive transcription uncovered by the ENCODE project, together with non-genic conservation and the abundance of noncoding RNA genes, have challenged the notion of the gene. To illustrate this, we review the evolution of operational definitions of a gene over the past century--from the abstract elements of heredity of Mendel and Morgan to the present-day ORFs enumerated in the sequence databanks. We then summarize the current ENCODE findings and provide a computational metaphor for the complexity. Finally, we propose a tentative update to the definition of a gene: A gene is a union of genomic sequences encoding a coherent set of potentially overlapping functional products. Our definition side-steps the complexities of regulation and transcription by removing the former altogether from the definition and arguing that final, functional gene products (rather than intermediate transcripts) should be used to group together entities associated with a single gene. It also manifests how integral the concept of biological function is in defining genes."

            "Eukaryotic genomes contain vast amounts of repetitive DNA derived from transposable elements (TEs). Large-scale sequencing of these genomes has produced an unprecedented wealth of information about the origin, diversity, and genomic impact of what was once thought to be \"junk DNA.\" This has also led to the identification of two new classes of DNA transposons, Helitrons and Polintons, as well as several new superfamilies and thousands of new families. TEs are evolutionary precursors of many genes, including RAG1, which plays a role in the vertebrate immune system. They are also the driving force in the evolution of epigenetic regulation and have a long-term impact on genomic stability and evolution. Remnants of TEs appear to be overrepresented in transcription regulatory modules and other regions conserved among distantly related species, which may have implications for our understanding of their impact on speciation."

            "Early studies of human Alu retrotransposons focused on their origin, evolution and biological properties, but current focus is shifting toward the effect of Alu elements on evolution of the human genome. Recent analyses indicate that numerous factors have affected the chromosomal distribution of Alu elements over time, including male-driven insertions, deletions and rapid CpG mutations after their retrotransposition. Unequal crossing over between Alu elements can lead to local mutations or to large segmental duplications responsible for genetic diseases and long-term evolutionary changes. Alu elements can also affect human (primate) evolution by introducing alternative splice sites in existing genes. Studying the Alu family in a human genomic context is likely to have general significance for our understanding of the evolutionary impact of other repetitive elements in diverse eukaryotic genomes."

The primate sequence is approximately 300 base pairs in length and is composed of two imperfectly repeated monomer units, whereas the rodent repeat consists of only a single monomer. Properties of this repeat sequence, its flanking sequences in chromosomal DNA, and RNA's transcribed from it suggest that it may be a mobile DNA element inserted at hundreds of thousands of different chromosomal locations."

            "Housekeeping genes are expressed across a wide variety of tissues. Since repetitive sequences have been reported to influence the expression of individual genes, we employed a novel approach to determine whether housekeeping genes can be distinguished from tissue-specific genes by their repetitive sequence context. We show that Alu elements are more highly concentrated around housekeeping genes while various longer (>400-bp) repetitive sequences (\"repeats\"), including Long Interspersed Nuclear Element-1 (LINE-1) elements, are excluded from these regions. We further show that isochore membership does not distinguish housekeeping genes from tissue-specific genes and that repetitive sequence environment distinguishes housekeeping genes from tissue-specific genes in every isochore. The distinct repetitive sequence environment, in combination with other previously published sequence properties of housekeeping genes, was used to develop a method of predicting housekeeping genes on the basis of DNA sequence alone. Using expression across tissue types as a measure of success, we demonstrate that repetitive sequence environment is by far the most important sequence feature identified to date for distinguishing housekeeping genes."

            "The University of California Santa Cruz (UCSC) Known Genes dataset is constructed by a fully automated process, based on protein data from Swiss-Prot/TrEMBL (UniProt) and the associated mRNA data from Genbank. The detailed steps of this process are described. Extensive cross-references from this dataset to other genomic and proteomic data were constructed. For each known gene, a details page is provided containing rich information about the gene, together with extensive links to other relevant genomic, proteomic and pathway data. As of July 2005, the UCSC Known Genes are available for human, mouse and rat genomes. The Known Genes serves as a foundation to support several key programs: the Genome Browser, Proteome Browser, Gene Sorter and Table Browser offered at the UCSC website. All the associated data files and program source code are also available. They can be accessed at http://genome.ucsc.edu. The genomic coverage of UCSC Known Genes, RefSeq, Ensembl Genes, H-Invitational and CCDS is analyzed. Although UCSC Known Genes offers the highest genomic and CDS coverage among major human and mouse gene sets, more detailed analysis suggests all of them could be further improved."

            "Alu repeats are the most abundant family of repeats in the human genome, with over 1 million copies comprising 10% of the genome. They have been implicated in human genetic disease and in the enrichment of gene-rich segmental duplications in the human genome, and they form a rich fossil record of primate and human history. Alu repeat elements are believed to have arisen from the replication of a small number of source elements, whose evolution over time gives rise to the 31 Alu subfamilies currently reported in Repbase Update. We apply a novel method to identify and statistically validate 213 Alu subfamilies. We build an evolutionary tree of these subfamilies and conclude that the history of Alu evolution is more complex than previous studies had indicated."

Accordingly, they all obey the same grammatical rule of TG/CA/CT excess and CG/TA deficiency. On the one hand, it is this very rule which keeps isoelectric points of most proteins near the neutral range. On the other hand, this rule creates numerous palindromes, thus maintaining symmetry between complementary strands. Many of these palindromes encode identical oligopeptides on both strands."

        ], 
        "abstract": [
            "Inverted repeats are unstable motifs in a genome, having a causal relation to fragment rearrangements and recombination events. We have investigated long inverted repeats (LIR) of > 30 bp in length in eukaryotic genomes to assess their contribution to genome stability. An algorithm was first designed for searching for LIRs with < 2 kb internal spacers and >85% identity (degree of homology between repeat copies of a LIR). There are much fewer LIRs in yeast, fruitfly, pufferfish and chicken than in Caenorhabditis elegans, zebrafish, frog and human. However, the high LIR frequencies do not necessarily imply high genome instability because of variant internal spacers and stem lengths and identities. From the collection of identified LIRs, we selected recombinogenic LIRs that had a short internal spacer and a high copy identity and were prone to induce high instability. We found that a relatively high proportion (5-9.8%) of the LIRs in C. elegans, zebrafish and frog were recombinogenic LIRs. In contrast, the proportions in human and mouse LIRs were quite low (0.4-1.1%) basically accounting for long internal spacers. We suggest that C. elegans, zebrafish and frog genomes are unstable in terms of the LIR frequency and the proportion of recombinogenic LIRs. For the other genomes, LIRs most likely have a minor impact."

        ], 
        "abstract": [
            "Alu sequences, the most abundant class of large dispersed DNA repeats in human chromosomes, contribute to human genome dynamics. Recently we reported that long inverted repeats, including human Alus, can be strong initiators of genetic change in yeast. We proposed that the potential for interactions between adjacent, closely related Alus would influence their stability and this would be reflected in their distribution. We have undertaken an extensive computational analysis of all Alus (the database is at http://dir.niehs.nih.gov/ALU) to better understand their distribution and circumstances under which Alu sequences might affect genome stability. Alus separated by <650 bp were categorized according to orientation, length of regions sharing high sequence identity, distance between highly identical regions, and extent of sequence identity. Nearly 50% of all Alu pairs have long alignable regions (>275 bp), corresponding to nearly full-length Alus, regardless of orientation. There are dramatic differences in the distributions and character of Alu pairs with closely spaced, nearly identical regions. For Alu pairs that are directly repetitive, approximately 30% have highly identical regions separated by <20 bp, but only when the alignments correspond to near full-size or half-size Alus. The opposite is found for the distribution of inverted repeats: Alu pairs with aligned regions separated by <20 bp are rare. Furthermore, closely spaced direct and inverted Alus differ in their truncation patterns, suggesting differences in the mechanisms of insertion. At larger distances, the direct and inverted Alu pairs have similar distributions. We propose that sequence identity, orientation, and distance are important factors determining insertion of adjacent Alus, the frequency and spectrum of Alu-associated changes in the genome, and the contribution of Alu pairs to genome instability. Based on results in model systems and the present analysis, closely spaced inverted Alu pairs with long regions of alignment are likely at-risk motifs (ARMs) for genome instability."

            "The sequence of the mouse genome is a key informational tool for understanding the contents of the human genome and a key experimental tool for biomedical research. Here, we report the results of an international collaboration to produce a high-quality draft sequence of the mouse genome. We also present an initial comparative analysis of the mouse and human genomes, describing some of the insights that can be gleaned from the two sequences. We discuss topics including the analysis of the evolutionary forces shaping the size, structure and sequence of the genomes; the conservation of large-scale synteny across most of the genomes; the much lower extent of sequence orthology covering less than half of the genomes; the proportions of the genomes under selection; the number of protein-coding genes; the expansion of gene families related to reproduction and immunity; the evolution of proteins; and the identification of intraspecies polymorphism."

            "Experimental production of hybrid embryos between Mus musculus L. and Rattus norvegicus L. was achieved by nuclear transplantation using both ovulated oocytes in metaphase II and pronuclear zygotes. Recipient egg-cells were of mouse origin in all cases. The developmental potential of hybrids was examined in vivo. Nucleo-cytoplasmic hybrids resulting from the introduction of rat metaphase II chromosomes into enucleated mouse oocytes, which were subsequently activated, were regularly blocked at the 1- or 2-cell stage. Nuclear (genetic) hybrids produced by transfer of a rat nucleus (in the form of metaphase II chromosomes or a pronucleus) into a nucleated mouse recipient (oocyte or zygote) were capable of development to the 5- to 8-cell stage. Transplantation of rat cytoplasm alone to intact metaphase II oocytes, followed by oocyte activation, generated cytoplasmic hybrids which developed to the morula stage. In control experiments (nuclear transfer between mouse oocytes or zygotes), a high proportion of embryos formed morulae and blastocysts. These results demonstrate that the rat nucleus is incapable of functioning in mouse cytoplasm, that introduction of the rat genome into intact mouse egg-cells impairs normal development, and that transfer of foreign (rat) cytoplasm into mouse egg-cells affects preimplantation development of manipulated embryos."

        "abstract": [
            "Adult stem cells reside in specialized microenvironments, or niches, that have an important role in regulating stem cell behaviour. Therefore, tight control of niche number, size and function is necessary to ensure the proper balance between stem cells and progenitor cells available for tissue homeostasis and wound repair. The stem cell niche in the Drosophila male gonad is located at the tip of the testis where germline and somatic stem cells surround the apical hub, a cluster of approximately 10-15 somatic cells that is required for stem cell self-renewal and maintenance. Here we show that somatic stem cells in the Drosophila testis contribute to both the apical hub and the somatic cyst cell lineage. The Drosophila orthologue of epithelial cadherin (DE-cadherin) is required for somatic stem cell maintenance and, consequently, the apical hub. Furthermore, our data indicate that the transcriptional repressor escargot regulates the ability of somatic cells to assume and/or maintain hub cell identity. These data highlight the dynamic relationship between stem cells and the niche and provide insight into genetic programmes that regulate niche size and function to support normal tissue homeostasis and organ regeneration throughout life."

        ], 
        "abstract": [
            "The morphological characteristics of cholinergic neurons in the central nervous system (CNS) of the baboon (Papio papio) were studied by choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) immunohistochemistry and acetylcholinesterase (AChE) pharmacohistochemistry. The distributions of central cholinergic neurons as visualized by these two histochemical techniques were similar in most, but not all regions of the brain and spinal cord. Based upon these observations, central cholinergic neurons that are immunoreactive to ChAT and intensely stained for AChE by the pharmacohistochemical procedure can be divided into four major groups: (1) those in the caudate nucleus, putamen, nucleus accumbens and anterior perforated substance. These ChAT-containing and AChE-intense neurons are large and multipolar, and are scattered throughout these structures. (2) The rostral cholinergic column, which consists of a continuous mass of cholinergic perikarya situated in the medial septal nucleus, nucleus of the diagonal band, and nucleus basalis (Meynert). The ChAT-immunoreactive and AChE-intense cell bodies of the nucleus basalis are a prominent feature in the basal forebrain of the baboon. The labeled neurons are large, multipolar, and hyperchromic and show a tendency to aggregate in cell clusters. These cells are distributed within the full extent of the substantia innominata, often being associated with subcortical fiber networks such as the medullary laminae of the globus pallidus. (3) The caudal cholinergic column, which consists of a continuous group of cholinergic neurons in the caudal midbrain and pontine tegmentum. The rostral component of this group of cells is the nucleus tegmenti pedunculopontinus (subnucleus compacta) and it extends caudally to include the laterodorsal tegmental nucleus. Compared to that in other species the nucleus tegmenti pedunculopontinus in the baboon appears to occupy a relatively greater volume and is composed of a greater number of cholinergic neurons. The cells of the caudal column are large and hyperchromic. (4) Nuclei of origin of somatic and visceral efferents of the cranial nerves (III, IV, V, VI, VII, IX, X, XI, XII) and spinal nerves. In addition to these major cholinergic cell groups, a small population of ChAT-positive and AChE-intense cell bodies can be observed at the floor of the fourth ventricle and in lamina VII and X of the cervical cord. The present findings indicate that although some differences exist, the overall distribution and morphological features of cholinergic cell bodies identified in the baboon brain and spinal cord are similar to those demonstrated previously in investigations of the rhesus monkey and nonprimates."

        "abstract": [
            "The morphologies, intercellular organization, and cortical projection patterns of putative cholinergic neurons in the basal forebrain of the rat were examined by use of fluorescent tracer histology in combination with the pharmacohistochemical regimen for acetylcholinesterase (AChE). Intensity staining AChE-containing cells projecting to frontal sensorimotor (Area 10), parietal (Area 2), and temporal (Area 4) cortices were found ipsilaterally in nucleus preopticus magnocellularis, in nucleus basalis, and in association with the substantia innominata, the ansa lenticularis, and the lateral hypothalamic area; an essentially rostrocaudal topography was observed for these projections. AChE-containing pathways to cingulate (Area 29) and visual (Area 17) cortices derived from ipsilateral somata associated with the vertical and horizontal limbs of the diagonal band, nucleus preopticus magnocellularis, rostral portions of nucleus basalis, and the substantia innominata. Neurons innervating Area 29 were generally located more rostrally than those giving rise to AChE afferents to Area 17. The vast majority of cells appeared to innervate relatively discrete areas of the cortex. Evidence for collateralization was found only in neurons projecting to visual and cingulate cortices, and these represented only 3.2% of the cells providing AChE afferents to Areas 17 and 29. The basal forebrain AChE projection cells were typically large (greater than 25 micron in maximum cell body extent), and their somata were predominantly oval, with lesser proportions being fusiform or triangular. Many were organized in clusters, particularly in nucleus basalis."

        "abstract": [
            "The structure and connectivity of the basal nucleus of Meynert, the substantia innominata in which it lies, and certain related areas have been examined in New World and Old World Monkeys, using retrograde and anterograde axonal transport methods. Experiments using the retrograde, horseradish peroxidase method confirm the observations of Kievet and Kuypers ('75) that the basal nucleus and substantia innominata project directly, heavily and with a somewhat crude topography upon the neocortex. Experiments involving the anterograde, autoradiographic method show that the basal nucleus and substantia innominata form part of a complex pathway that links them together with the lateral hypothalamus, certain parts of the amygdala and the peripeduncular nucleus of the midbrain. The peripeduncular nucleus is often regarded as a part of the central auditory pathway; it gives rise to a fiber bundle of considerable size that ascends on the dorsal surface of the ipsilateral optic tract and terminates ultimately in the lateral hypothalamic area of both sides. As well as distributing fibers to the basal nucleus, substantia innominata and lateral hypothalamus, this pathway provides a heavy projection to a cytoarchitectonically distinct posterior part of the lateral nucleus of the amygdala, the medial and intercalated nuclei of the amygdala and a less dense projection to the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis. Certain parts of the hypothalamus and possibly the preoptic areas give rise to a complementary descending pathway that distributes fibers to the ipsilateral basal nucleus, substantia innominata and amygdala, and ends in the peripeduncular nuclei of both sides. Decussating fibers in both the ascending and descending pathways cross in the ventral supraoptic commissure. It is concluded that the basal nucleus should include most of the aggregated and unaggregated large cells that lie in the substantia innominata and which in places intrude upon the preoptic regions and the nucleus of the diagnonal band of Broca. Together, these may form a complex that receives inputs from a variety of brainstem sources, and projects widely and diffusely upon all cortical structures of the telencephalon."

            "The goal of the present study was to determine whether the architectonic criteria used to identify the core region in macaque monkeys (Macaca mulatta, M. nemestrina) could be used to identify a homologous region in chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) and humans (Homo sapiens). Current models of auditory cortical organization in primates describe a centrally located core region containing two or three subdivisions including the primary auditory area (AI), a surrounding belt of cortex with perhaps seven divisions, and a lateral parabelt region comprised of at least two fields. In monkeys the core region can be identified on the basis of specific anatomical and physiological features. In this study, the core was identified from serial sets of adjacent sections processed for cytoarchitecture, myeloarchitecture, acetylcholinesterase, and cytochrome oxidase. Qualitative and quantitative criteria were used to identify the borders of the core region in individual sections. Serial reconstructions of each brain were made showing the location of the core with respect to gross anatomical landmarks. The position of the core with respect to major sulci and gyri in the superior temporal region varied most in the chimpanzee and human specimens. Although the architectonic appearance of the core areas did vary in certain respects across taxonomic groups, the numerous similarities made it possible to identify unambiguously a homologous cortical region in macaques, chimpanzees, and humans."

        "abstract": [
            "Cortical neurons immunoreactive to nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChR) of the rat brain were characterized with monoclonal antibodies directed to ACh-binding subunits (alpha 4) or to ACh-structural subunits (beta 2). A heterogeneous population of nAChR-LI neurons was found in all cortical regions. The most prominent immunoreactive neurons were pyramids of layers V and II-III. The nonpyramidal positive neurons were fusiform horizontally oriented neurons of layer VIb, small cells of layer I and round or ovoid neurons of layers II-V. Double labeled experiments (immunohistochemistry and fluorescent retrograde tracers) showed that cholinoceptive pyramidal neurons of layer V project mainly to subcortical targets such as caudate-putamen, superior colliculus, and pontine nuclei, while very few nAChR positive neurons connect to other cortical areas. These findings suggest that the mainly excitatory effect that has been attributed to the cholinergic innervation upon the cortical neurons may have a greater influence upon the cortico-subcortical output than the corticortical one."

Vienna/Berlin [Germany]: Springer). We report here on intrinsic connections within these areas, as revealed with biotinylated dextran amine and 1,1'-dioctadecyl-3,3,3',3'-tetramethylindocarbocyanine perchlorate tracing in postmortem human brains. Injections limited to supragranular layers revealed a complex intrinsic network of horizontal connections within layers II and III spreading over several millimeters and to a lesser extent within layers IV, V, and VI. Ninety percent of the retrogradely labeled neurons (n = 734) were in supragranular layers, 4% in layer IV, and 6% in infragranular layers; most were pyramids and tended to be grouped into clusters of approximately 500 microm in diameter. Injections involving layer IV revealed extended horizontal connections within layers I-IV (up to 3.7 mm) and to a lesser extent in layers V and VI. Injections limited to the infragranular layers revealed horizontal connections mainly limited to these layers. Thus, intrinsic connections within Broca's area display a strong laminar specificity. This pattern is very similar in areas FDgamma and FCBm and in the 2 hemispheres."

Latencies for arithmetic operations were a function of the setsize of active but not passive sets. Object-switch costs were observed when successive operations were applied to different digits within an active set. Participants took 2 s to encode a passive set so that it did not affect processing latencies (Experiment 2). The results support a model distinguishing 3 states of representations in working memory: the activated part of long-term memory, a capacity limited region of direct access, and a focus of attention."

            "Recent neurobiological studies have begun to reveal the cognitive and neural coding mechanisms that underlie declarative memory--our ability to recollect everyday events and factual knowledge. These studies indicate that the critical circuitry involves bidirectional connections between the neocortex, the parahippocampal region and the hippocampus. Each of these areas makes a unique contribution to memory processing. Widespread high-order neocortical areas provide dedicated processors for perceptual, motor or cognitive information that is influenced by other components of the system. The parahippocampal region mediates convergence of this information and extends the persistence of neocortical memory representations. The hippocampus encodes the sequences of places and events that compose episodic memories, and links them together through their common elements. Here I describe how these mechanisms work together to create and re-create fully networked representations of previous experiences and knowledge about the world."

            "The understanding of the structural and dynamic complexity of mammalian brains is greatly facilitated by computer simulations. We present here a detailed large-scale thalamocortical model based on experimental measures in several mammalian species. The model spans three anatomical scales. (i) It is based on global (white-matter) thalamocortical anatomy obtained by means of diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) of a human brain. (ii) It includes multiple thalamic nuclei and six-layered cortical microcircuitry based on in vitro labeling and three-dimensional reconstruction of single neurons of cat visual cortex. (iii) It has 22 basic types of neurons with appropriate laminar distribution of their branching dendritic trees. The model simulates one million multicompartmental spiking neurons calibrated to reproduce known types of responses recorded in vitro in rats. It has almost half a billion synapses with appropriate receptor kinetics, short-term plasticity, and long-term dendritic spike-timing-dependent synaptic plasticity (dendritic STDP). The model exhibits behavioral regimes of normal brain activity that were not explicitly built-in but emerged spontaneously as the result of interactions among anatomical and dynamic processes. We describe spontaneous activity, sensitivity to changes in individual neurons, emergence of waves and rhythms, and functional connectivity on different scales."

            "The basal ganglia, of which the striatum is the major component, process inputs from virtually all cerebral cortical areas to affect motor, emotional, and cognitive behaviors. Insights into how these seemingly disparate functions may be integrated have emerged from studies that have demonstrated that the mammalian striatum is composed of two compartments arranged as a mosaic, the patches and the matrix, which differ in their neurochemical and neuroanatomical properties. In this study, projections from prefrontal, cingulate, and motor cortical areas to the striatal compartments were examined with the Phaseolus vulgaris-leucoagglutinin (PHA-L) anterograde axonal tracer in rats. Each cortical area projects to both the patches and the matrix of the striatum; however, deep layer V and layer VI corticostriatal neurons project principally to the patches, whereas superficial layer V and layer III and II corticostriatal neurons project principally to the matrix. The relative contribution of patch and matrix corticostriatal projections varies among the cortical areas examined such that allocortical areas provide a greater number of inputs to the patches than to the matrix, whereas the reverse obtains for neocortical areas. These results demonstrate that the compartmental organization of corticostriatal inputs is related to their laminar origin and secondarily to the cytoarchitectonic area of origin."

            "The striatum, which is the major component of the basal ganglia, displays a complex mosaic organization of neurochemical systems that are related to its neuroanatomical connections. This mosaic organization reflects multiple levels of functional compartments. The first level is determined by the segregation of two major striatal output systems, one to the globus pallidus (external segment) and the other to the entopeduncular nucleus and substantia nigra. The second level segregates the cortical outputs of sublaminae of layer V between the patch and matrix compartments of the striatum, which project to the dopaminergic and GABAergic neurons in the substantia nigra, respectively. The third level is related to the topography of cortical inputs by which regions of the striatum may be functionally defined on the basis of the cortical areas with which they are connected. Neurochemical markers display complex mosaic patterns in the striatum that, when examined in the context of the multi-level compartmental organization of the striatum, reveal the highly organized manner by which the striatum processes cortical information."

        "abstract": [
            "The directionality of corticocortical projections is classified as feedforward (going from a lower to higher hierarchical levels), feedback (interconnecting descending levels), and lateral (interconnecting equivalent levels). Directionality is determined by the combined criteria of the laminar patterns of the axon terminals as well as the cells of origins and has been used to construct models of the visual system, which reveals a strict hierarchical organization (Felleman and Van Essen, 1991; Hilgetag et al., 1996a). However, these models are indeterminate partly because we have no indication of the distance separating adjacent levels. Here we have attempted to determine a graded parameter describing the anatomical relationship of interconnected areas. We have investigated whether the precise percentage of labeled supragranular layer neurons (SLN%) in each afferent area after injection in either visual areas V1 or V4 determines its hierarchical position in the model. This shows that pathway directionality in the Felleman and Van Essen model is characterized by a range of SLN% values. The one exception is the projection of the frontal eye field to area V4, which resembles a feedforward projection. Individual areal differences in SLN% values are highly significant, and the number of hierarchical steps separating a target area from a source area is found to be tightly correlated to SLN%. The present results show that the hierarchical rank of each afferent area is reliably indicated by SLN%, and therefore this constitutes a graded parameter that is related to hierarchical distance."

            "The dorsomedial visual area (DM) of owl monkeys is a cortical area that has been described recently in a range of primate species. To study the thalamic connections of this area, injections of several distinguishable neuroanatomical tracers were placed into DM in galagos, owl monkeys, squirrel monkeys, and macaque monkeys. The distribution of label was remarkably consistent across these diverse primate species. Labeled connections were densest within the pulvinar complex. Both the lateral and inferior divisions of the pulvinar, but not the medial division, had connections with DM. Within the inferior pulvinar of monkeys, central lateral and central medial nuclei had dense connections, and the medial and posterior nuclei had sparse connections with DM. Sparser connections were revealed in the lateral geniculate nucleus and the nucleus limitans. Anterograde label was also found in the superior colliculus. The consistencies in the pattern of subcortical projections across prosimian primates, New World monkeys, and Old World monkeys support the concept that DM is a visual area common to all primates. In addition, these results provide further evidence for proposed subdivisions of the inferior pulvinar."

        ], 
        "abstract": [
            "To investigate the fine anatomical organization of cortical inputs to visual association area TE, 2-3 small injections of retrograde tracers were made in macaque monkeys. Injections were made as a terminal procedure, after optical imaging and electrophysiological recording, and targeted to patches physiologically identified as object-selective. Retrogradely labeled neurons occurred in several unimodal visual areas, the superior temporal sulcus, intraparietal sulcus (IPS), and prefrontal cortex (PFC), consistent with previous studies. Despite the small injection size (<0.5 mm wide), the projection foci in visual areas, but not in IPS or PFC, were spatially widespread (4-6 mm in extent), and predominantly consisted of neurons labeled by only one of the injections. This can be seen as a quasi-modular organization. In addition, within each projection focus, there were scattered neurons projecting to one of the other injections, together with some double-labeled (DL) neurons, in a more distributed pattern. Finally, projection foci included smaller \"hotspots,\" consisting of intermixed neurons, single-labeled by the different injections, and DL neurons. DL neurons are likely the result of axons having extended, spatially separated terminal arbors, as demonstrated by anterograde experiments. These results suggest a complex, hybrid connectivity architecture, with both modular and distributed components."

        ], 
        "abstract": [
            "The rat neostriatum has a mosaic organization composed of striosome/patch compartments embedded in a more extensive matrix compartment, which are distinguished from each other by the input-output organization as well as by the expression of many molecular markers. The matrix compartment gives rise to the dual gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)ergic striatofugal systems, i.e. direct and indirect pathway neurons, whereas the striosome compartment is considered to involve direct pathway neurons alone. Although the whole axonal arborization of matrix striatofugal neurons has been examined in vivo by intracellular staining, that of striosome neurons has never been studied at the single neuron level. In the present study, the axonal arborizations of single striosome projection neurons in rat neostriatum were visualized in their entirety using a viral vector expressing membrane-targeted green fluorescent protein, and compared with that of matrix projection neurons. We found that not only matrix but also striosome compartments contained direct and indirect pathway neurons. Furthermore, only striatonigral neurons in the striosome compartment projected directly to the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc), although they sent a substantial number of axon collaterals to the globus pallidus, entopeduncular nucleus and/or substantia nigra pars reticulata. These results suggest that striosome neurons play a more important role in the formation of reward-related signals of SNc dopaminergic neurons than do matrix neurons. Together with data from previous studies in the reinforcement learning theory, our results suggest that these direct and indirect striosome-SNc pathways together with nigrostriatal dopaminergic neurons may help striosome neurons to acquire the state-value function."

            "The basal ganglia are a chain of subcortical nuclei that facilitate action selection. Two striatal projection systems-so-called direct and indirect pathways-form the functional backbone of the basal ganglia circuit. Twenty years ago, investigators proposed that the striatum's ability to use dopamine (DA) rise and fall to control action selection was due to the segregation of D1 and D2 DA receptors in direct- and indirect-pathway spiny projection neurons. Although this hypothesis sparked a debate, the evidence that has accumulated since then clearly supports this model. Recent advances in the means of marking neural circuits with optical or molecular reporters have revealed a clear-cut dichotomy between these two cell types at the molecular, anatomical, and physiological levels. The contrast provided by these studies has provided new insights into how the striatum responds to fluctuations in DA signaling and how diseases that alter this signaling change striatal function. Expected final online publication date for the Annual Review of Neuroscience Volume 34 is June 17, 2011. Please see http://www.annualreviews.org/catalog/pubdates.aspx for revised estimates."

        "abstract": [
            "The striatum (caudate-putamen) of the basal ganglia in the mammalian forebrain is a mosaic of two interdigitating, neurochemically distinct compartments. One type, the 'patch' compartment, is identified by patches of dense opiate receptor binding, and is enriched in enkephalin- and substance P-like immunoreactivity. The other compartment, the 'matrix', has a high acetylcholinesterase activity, and is shown here to have a dense plexus of fibres displaying somatostatin-like immunoreactivity. The present study demonstrates the two compartments have distinct connections, using a method that concurrently reveals striatal input, output and neurochemical systems in the rat. Patches receive inputs from the prelimbic cortex (a medial frontal cortical area with direct 'limbic' inputs from the amygdala and hippocampus); they also project to the substantia nigra pars compacta (the source of the nigrostriatal dopaminergic system). Conversely, the matrix receives inputs from sensory and motor cortical areas; here it is shown to project to the substantia nigra pars reticulata (the source of the non-dopaminergic nigrothalamic and nigrotectal system). Also, an intrinsic striatal somatostatin-immunoreactive system is described that may provide a link between the two compartments. The striatal patch and matrix compartments thus appear to be functionally distinct and interactive parallel input-output processing channels."

        ], 
        "abstract": [
            "It is well known that the striatum has a chemical architecture dividing it into striosomes and matrix, and that these compartments have different input-output connections. However, striatal afferent-fiber systems also form vividly patchy terminal fields in the matrix, and studies in the past year have uncovered instances of nonstriosomal clustering of striatal output neurons. In the experiments reported here, we systematically investigated this output-neuron clustering in the primate, using the striatopallidal system as a model. Our goals were to determine whether the modular organization is a general characteristic of projection neurons in the striatal matrix, whether the modularity occurs independent of striosomal boundaries, and whether the output modules are systematically organized. We studied the distribution of striatopallidal projection neurons in 9 adult squirrel monkeys by centering deposits of the retrograde tracer HRP-WGA in either the external segment or the internal segment of the globus pallidus. Following injections of each type, many retrogradely labeled neurons appeared in the striatal matrix in clusters and bands having cross-sectional diameters of 0.2-0.8 mm. Comparisons with adjoining sections stained to demonstrate striosomes established that the local groups of striatal output neurons sometimes abutted striosomes but often did not. The retrogradely labeled clusters and bands appeared both in the caudate nucleus and in the putamen. Their arrangements were regular and often periodic. These findings suggest that the large matrix compartment of the primate striatum, which is the primary site of origin of striatal outputs to the pallidum and the reticular part of the substantia nigra, contains systematic mosaics of projection neurons. We propose that this output-neuron modularity of the striatal matrix in the primate could serve as the template for redistribution of the massive afferent-fiber systems of the striatum into specialized striatopallidal output channels."

        "abstract": [
            "Although the midline and intralaminar thalamic nuclei (MITN) were long believed to project \"nonspecifically,\" they are now known from rat studies to have restricted connections to the prefrontal cortex. This has not been studied thoroughly in primates, however, and it is not known how MITN are associated with the \"orbital\" and \"medial\" prefrontal networks. This study examined the connections of MITN in cynomolgus monkeys (Macaca fascicularis). Experiments with retrograde and anterograde tracer injections into the orbital and medial prefrontal cortex (OMPFC) showed that MITN are strongly connected with the medial prefrontal network. The dorsal nuclei of the midline thalamus, including the paraventricular (Pa) and parataenial nuclei (Pt), had heavy connections with medial network areas 25, 32, and 14c in the subgenual region. Areas 13a and 12o, which are associated with both networks, were strongly connected with the Pt and the central intermedial nucleus, respectively. Otherwise, orbital network areas had weak connections with MITN. Anterograde tracer injections into the dorsal midline thalamus resulted in heavy terminal labeling in the medial prefrontal network, most notably in areas ventral to the genu of the corpus callosum (25, 32, and 14c), but also in adjacent areas (13a and 13b). Retrograde tracer injection into the dorsal midline labeled similar areas. The medial network, particularly the subgenual region, is involved in visceral and emotional control and has been implicated in mood disorders. The strong connections between the subgenual cortex and the Pa provide a pathway through which stress signals from the Pa may influence these prefrontal circuits."

            "In many areas of the vertebrate brain, such as the cerebral and cerebellar cortices, neural circuits rely on inhibition mediated by GABA (gamma-aminobutyric acid) to shape the spatiotemporal patterns of electrical signalling. The richness and subtlety of inhibition are achieved by diverse classes of interneurons that are endowed with distinct physiological properties. In addition, the axons of interneurons display highly characteristic and class-specific geometry and innervation patterns, and thereby distribute their output to discrete spatial domains, cell types and subcellular compartments in neural networks. The cellular and molecular mechanisms that specify and modify inhibitory innervation patterns are only just beginning to be understood."

            "The connections of the dopaminergic system with the striatum in rats and primates: an analysis with respect to the functional and compartmental organization of the striatum"
        ], 
        "abstract": [
            "This Commentary compares the connections of the dopaminergic system with the striatum in rats and primates with respect to two levels of striatal organization: a tripartite functional (motor, associative and limbic) subdivision and a compartmental (patch/striosome-matrix) subdivision. The topography of other basal ganglia projections to the dopaminergic system with respect to their tripartite functional subdivision is also reviewed. This examination indicates that, in rats and primates, the following observations can be made. (1) The limbic striatum reciprocates its dopaminergic input and in addition innervates most of the dopaminergic neurons projecting to the associative and motor striatum, whereas the motor and associative striatum reciprocate only part of their dopaminergic input. Therefore, the connections of the three striatal subregions with the dopaminergic system are asymmetrical, but the direction of asymmetry differs between the limbic versus the motor and associative striatum. (2) The limbic striatum provides the main striatal input to dopamine cell bodies and proximal dendrites, with some contribution from a subset of neurons in the associative and motor striatum (patch neurons in rats; an unspecified group of neurons in primates), while striatal input to the ventrally extending dopamine dendrites arises mainly from a subset of neurons in the associative and motor striatum (matrix neurons in rats; an unspecified group of neurons in primates). (3) Projections from functionally corresponding subdivisions of the striatum, pallidum and subthalamic nucleus to the dopaminergic system overlap, but the specific targets (dopamine cells, dopamine dendrites, GABA cells) of these projections differ. Major differences include the following. (1) In rats, neurons projecting to the motor and associative striatum reside in distinct regions, while in primates they are arranged in interdigitating clusters. (2) In rats, the terminal fields of projections arising from the motor and associative striatum are largely segregated, while in primates they are not. (3) In rats, patch- and matrix-projecting dopamine cells are organized in spatially, morphologically, histochemically and hodologically distinct ventral and dorsal tiers, while in primates there is no (bi)division of the dopaminergic system that results in two areas which have all the characteristics of the two tiers in rats. Based on the anatomical data and known dopamine cell physiology, we forward an hypothesis regarding the influence of the basal ganglia on dopamine cell activity which captures at least part of the complex interplay taking place within the substantia nigra between projections arising from the different basal ganglia nuclei. Finally, we incorporate the striatal connections with the dopaminergic system into an open-interconnected scheme of basal ganglia-thalamocortical circuitry."

            "Evidence for differential cortical input to direct pathway versus indirect pathway striatal projection neurons in rats"
        ], 
        "abstract": [
            "The two main types of corticostriatal neurons are those that project only intratelencephalically (IT-type), the intrastriatal terminals of which are 0.41 microm in mean diameter, and those that send their main axon into pyramidal tract and have a collateral projection to striatum (PT-type), the intrastriatal terminals of which are 0.82 microm in mean diameter. We used three approaches to examine whether the two striatal projection neuron types (striatonigral direct pathway vs striatopallidal indirect pathway) differ in their input from IT-type and PT-type neurons. First, we retrogradely labeled one striatal projection neuron type or the other with biotinylated dextran amine (BDA)-3000 molecular weight. We found that terminals making asymmetric axospinous contact with striatonigral neurons were 0.43 microm in mean diameter, whereas those making asymmetric axospinous contact with striatopallidal neurons were 0.69 microm. Second, we preferentially immunolabeled striatonigral neurons for D1 dopamine receptors or striatopallidal neurons for D2 dopamine receptors and found that axospinous terminals had a smaller mean size (0.45 microm) on D1+ spines than on D2+ spines (0.61 microm). Finally, we combined selective BDA labeling of IT-type or PT-type terminals with immunolabeling for D1 or D2, and found that IT-type terminals were twice as common as PT-type on D1+ spines, whereas PT-type terminals were four times as common as IT-type on D2+ spines. These various results suggest that striatonigral neurons preferentially receive input from IT-type cortical neurons, whereas striatopallidal neurons receive greater input from PT-type cortical neurons. This differential cortical connectivity may further the roles of the direct and indirect pathways in promoting desired movements and suppressing unwanted movements, respectively."

        ], 
        "abstract": [
            "The present research was aimed at ascertaining in the macaque monkey the reciprocity of the heterotopical callosal connections between SI and SII, with particular regard to the connectivity of the hand representation, and at comparing the topographical and laminar pattern of these callosal connections with those of association connections entertained by these areas. Horseradish peroxidase (HRP) was unilaterally injected into area SI in five monkeys. The sites of HRP delivery included the trunk and the hand zones preliminarily identified by recording multi-unit responses to peripheral stimulation by means of microelectrodes. Anterograde and retrograde labelling was studied in SII of both sides. The results showed the complete reciprocity of the heterotopical callosal connections between SI and SII. In the latter area both callosal axon terminals and neurones were found, which were labelled from either the trunk or the hand zone of contralateral SI. Labelling of callosal axon terminals occurred mainly in layer IV and in the lowermost part of layer III. Labelled callosal neurones were mainly in the lower half of layer III, whereas few occurred in infragranular layers. Topographically, the distribution of callosal terminals and cell bodies duplicated the distribution of association terminals and cell bodies labelled in SII on the side ipsilateral to HRP injection. The laminar pattern of termination of association fibres from SI was similar to that of callosal fibres. However, the distribution of association-projecting neurones in SII showed a striking difference from that of callosal-projecting neurones. Unlike the latter neurones, which were mainly located in supragranular layers, association cell bodies overwhelmingly dwelt in layers V and VI and were less numerous in layers II and III. This laminar pattern of association SII-SI cells corresponds to the \"feed-backward\" model and fits the laminar pattern of their axon terminations (Friedman: Brain Res. 273: 147-151, '83). The association and callosal inputs and outputs of area SII are discussed in relation to the function of the forward and backward type of reciprocal connections entertained with SI in the ipsilateral hemisphere and to the function of SII in the interhemispheric exchange of somatosensory information."

        "abstract": [
            "The axonal arbors of single nigrostriatal dopaminergic neurons were visualized with a viral vector expressing membrane-targeted green fluorescent protein in rat brain. All eight reconstructed tyrosine hydroxylase-positive dopaminergic neurons possessed widely spread and highly dense axonal arborizations in the neostriatum. All of them emitted very little axon collateral arborization outside of the striatum except for tiny arborization in the external pallidum. The striatal axonal bush of each reconstructed dopaminergic neuron covered 0.45-5.7% (mean +/- SD = 2.7 +/- 1.5%) of the total volume of the neostriatum. Furthermore, all the dopaminergic neurons innervated both striosome and matrix compartments of the neostriatum, although each neuron's arborization tended to favor one of these compartments. Our findings demonstrate that individual dopaminergic neurons of the substantia nigra can broadcast a dopamine signal and exert strong influence over a large number of striatal neurons. This divergent signaling should be a key to the function of the nigrostriatal system in dopamine-based learning and suggests that neurodegeneration of individual nigral neurons can affect multiple neurons in the striatum. Thus, these results would also contribute to understanding the clinicopathology of Parkinson's disease and related syndromes."

            "Thalamic strokes in 62 patients selected from the Stroke Data Bank were studied to determine differences among 18 infarctions (INF), 23 localized hemorrhages (ICH), and 21 hematomas with ventricular extension (IVH). Stupor or coma at onset occurred more frequently in the IVH (62%) than in the INF (6%) or ICH (13%) groups and was reflected in significantly lower median Glasgow Coma Scores in the IVH group (7) than in the INF (15) and ICH (14) groups. Although ocular movements were more frequently abnormal in the IVH group compared with the ICH and INF groups, no significant differences were found in the frequency of motor or sensory deficits. Among the 62 strokes, 32 had restricted lesions of the posterolateral (n = 9), anterior (n = 3), paramedian (n = 7), and dorsal (n = 13) portions of the thalamus. Differences in consciousness and in motor, sensory, and oculomotor deficits were found among the topographic subgroups. Stroke-related deaths occurred in 52% of IVH cases, 13% of ICH cases, and no cases of INF. Median lesion volume as detected with computed tomography was greater in hemorrhages (INF, 2 cm3; ICH, 10 cm3; IVH, 16 cm3), with mortality related to increasing hematoma size. Coma, Glasgow Coma Score lower than 9, weakness score greater than 15 of a possible 30, abnormal ocular movements, and fixed pupils were also associated with stroke-related mortality. We conclude that the initial neurologic syndrome does not discriminate infarcts from intrathalamic hemorrhages. Ventricular extension, however, causes significantly more severe deficits and higher mortality."

        ], 
        "abstract": [
            "One dimension of understanding the functions of the prefrontal cortex is knowledge of cortical connectivity. We have surveyed three aspects of prefrontal cortical connections: local projections (within the frontal lobe), the termination patterns of long association (post-Rolandic) projections, and the trajectories of major fiber pathways. The local connections appear to be organized in relation to dorsal (hippocampal origin) and ventral (paleocortical origin) architectonic trends. According to the proposal of a dual origin of the cerebral cortex, cortical areas can be traced as originating from archicortex (hippocampus) on the one hand, and paleocortex, on the other hand, in a stepwise manner (e.g., Sanides, 1969; Pandya and Yeterian, 1985). Prefrontal areas within each trend are connected with less architectonically differentiated areas, and also with more differentiated areas. Such organization may allow for the systematic exchange of information within each architectonic trend. The long connections of the prefrontal cortex with post-Rolandic regions seem to be organized preferentially in relation to dorsal and ventral prefrontal architectonic trends. Prefrontal areas are connected with post-Rolandic auditory, visual and somatosensory association areas, and with multimodal and paralimbic regions. This long connectivity likely works in conjunction with local connections to serve prefrontal cortical functions. The afferent and efferent connections of the prefrontal cortex with post-Rolandic regions are conveyed by specific long association pathways. These pathways as well appear to be organized in relation to dorsal and ventral prefrontal architectonic trends. Finally, although prefrontal areas have preferential connections in relation to dual architectonic trends, it is clear that there are interconnections between and among areas in each trend, which may provide a substrate for the overall integrative function of the prefrontal cortex. Prefrontal corticocortical connectivity may help to elucidate both region-specific and integrative perspectives on the functions of the prefrontal cortex."

            "The subcortical afferent connections of the entorhinal cortex of the Macaca fascicularis monkey were investigated by the placement of small injections of the retrograde tracer wheat germ agglutinin conjugated to horseradish peroxidase into each of its subdivisions. Retrogradely labeled cells were observed in several subcortical regions including the amygdaloid complex, claustrum, basal forebrain, thalamus, hypothalamus, and brainstem. In the amygdala, labeled cells were observed principally in the lateral nucleus, the accessory basal nucleus, the deep or paralaminar portion of the basal nucleus, and the periamygdaloid cortex. Additional retrogradely labeled cells were found in the endopiriform nucleus, the anterior amygdaloid area, and the cortical nuclei. Retrogradely labeled cells were observed throughout much of the rostrocaudal extent of the claustrum and tended to be located in its ventral half. In the basal forebrain, retrogradely labeled cells were observed in the medial septal nucleus, the nucleus of the diagonal band, and to lesser extent within the substantia innominata. Several of the cells in the latter region were large and located within the densely packed neuronal clusters of the basal nucleus of Meynert. Most of the labeled cells in the thalamus were located in the midline nuclei. Many were found in nucleus reuniens, but even greater numbers were located in the centralis complex. Additional labeled cells were located in the paraventricular and parataenial nuclei. In all cases, numerous retrogradely labeled cells were observed in the medial pulvinar. In the hypothalamus, most of the retrogradely labeled cells were located in the supramamillary area, though scattered cells were also observed in the perifornical region and in the lateral hypothalamic area. Caudal to the mamillary nuclei there were labeled cells in the ventral tegmental area. There were relatively few labeled cells in the brainstem and these were invariably located either in the raphe nuclei or locus coeruleus."

        ], 
        "abstract": [
            "The ventral striatum is considered to be that portion of the striatum associated with the limbic system by virtue of its afferent connections from allocortical and mesolimbic areas as well as from the amygdala. The efferent projections from this striatal region in the primate were traced by using 3H amino acids and Phaseolus vulgaris-leucoagglutinin (PHA-L). Particular attention was paid to the topographic organization of terminal fields in the globus pallidus and substantia nigra, the projections to non-extrapyramidal areas, the relationship between projections from the nucleus accumbens and the other parts of the ventral striatum, and the comparison between ventral and dorsal striatal projections. This study demonstrates that in monkeys a circumscribed region of the globus pallidus receives topographically organized efferent fibers from the ventral striatum. The ventral striatal fibers terminate in the ventral pallidum, the subcommissural part of the globus pallidus, the rostral pole of the external segment, and the rostromedial portion of the internal segment. The more central and caudal portions of the globus pallidus do not receive this input. This striatal output appears to remain segregated from the dorsal striatal efferent projections to pallidal structures. Fibers from the ventral striatum projecting to the substantia nigra are not as confined to a specific region as those projecting to the globus pallidus. Although the densest terminal fields occur in the medial portion, numerous fibers also extend laterally to innervate the dorsal stratum of dopaminergic neurons of the substantia nigra and the retrorubral area. Furthermore, they project throughout the rostral-caudal extent of the substantia nigra. Projections from the medial part of the ventral striatum reach the more caudally located pedunculopontine tegmental nucleus. Thus unlike the above described terminals in the globus pallidus, the ventral striatum project widely throughout the substantia nigra, a fact that indicates that they may contribute to the integration between limbic and other output systems of the striatum. Finally, the ventral striatum projects to non-extrapyramidal regions including the bed nucleus of the stria terminals, the nucleus basalis magnocellularis, the lateral hypothalamus, and the medial thalamus."

            "Reports from previous works has given different classifications for the nucleus accumbens. There also appears to be a general lack of information regarding the fiber connections of the nucleus. The present investigation was undertaken to clarify the connections of this structure. Silver impregnation methods were used to discern some of the afferent fibers of the nucleus, and autoradiographic techniques were used to locate target areas of efferent projections. Afferents were found to be predominately from the septum. Other sources of possible afferents were the mid cingulate gyrus and the ventral nucleus of the diagonal band. No argyrophilia was observed in the nucleus accumbens following transection of the fornix body, lesions of the anterior orbital frontal cortex or anterior cingulate gyrus. On the basis of grain counts made from autoradiographic studies, the nucleus accumbens projects predominately to the lateral hypothalamus. Counts above background were found in the cingulate gyrus, septum, ventral nucleus of the diagonal band, midline thalamic nuclei, habenula, caudate and substantia nigra. Thus, efferent projections appear to distribute to both limbic and extrapyramidal structures. Considering these connections and the functions reported by various workers the nucleus accumbens may serve as bridge between limbic and extrapyramidal motor systems effecting limbic influence in some movements."

            "The monumental Atlas of Cytoarchitectonics of the Adult Human Cerebral Cortex of Economo and Koskinas represents a gigantic intellectual and technical effort, never sufficiently recognized. One reason might have been the limited number of copies produced; another, the complex (albeit logical and precise) symbol notation, which comprises a Roman capital (from the initial of the respective lobe), a calligraphic capital (the sequence of a gyrus within a lobe), and a Latin or Greek subscript (for microscopic features). Economo and Koskinas defined 107 cortical areas, as opposed to Brodmann's 44 areas for the human brain. Their cytoarchitectonic criteria confer the advantage of a more detailed parcellation scheme, despite the traditional familiarity of neuroscientists with Brodmann numbers. The system of 107 areas of Economo and Koskinas may be especially useful for modern studies on functional localization."

One way to make the Economo-Koskinas system more practical is to encode the complex symbol notations of the 107 cortical areas with numbers EK 1 through EK 107.

            "The neocortex of primates, including humans, is thought to contain significantly higher numbers and more diverse forms of gamma-aminobutyric acidergic (GABAergic) interneurons than that of rodents. The mouse cortex displays a number of other features that distinguish it from the cortex of primates and suggest a somewhat less complex pattern of organization. Nevertheless, dramatic findings on the origins and migratory patterns of newly specified GABAergic cortical interneurons in the embryonic mouse have led to a prevailing view that GABAergic cortical interneurons of all species are born in the ganglionic eminence and undergo the same long tangential migration toward the cortex that is seen in the mouse. Recent observations in fetal human and monkey brains, although clearly identifying GABAergic neurons that reach the neocortex via the tangential route, also demonstrate that substantial numbers of GABA neurons are generated in the lateral ventricular neuroepithelium and migrate into the cortex via the same radial route followed by glutamatergic neurons. In the course of evolution of the higher primate cortex, it is likely that new forms of cortical interneuron with origins in the ventricular neuroepithelium have been added to an older population derived from the ganglionic eminence."

The classification of interneurons in the primate neocortex is further complicated by a less extensive database of the features of these neurons and by reported interspecies differences. Consequently, in this study we characterized 8 different morphological types of interneurons from monkey prefrontal cortex, 4 of which have not been previously classified. These interneuron types differed in their expression of molecular markers and clustered into 3 different electrophysiological classes. The first class consisted of fast-spiking parvalbumin-positive chandelier and linear arbor cells. The second class comprised 5 different morphological types of continuous-adapting calretinin- or calbindin-positive interneurons that had the lowest level of firing threshold. However, 2 of these morphological types had short spike duration, which is not typical for rodent adapting cells. Neurogliaform cells (NGFCs), which coexpressed calbindin and neuropeptide Y, formed the third class, characterized by strong initial adaptation. They did not exhibit the delayed spikes seen in rodent NGFCs. These results indicate that primate interneurons have some specific properties; consequently, direct translation of classification schemes developed from studies in rodents to primates might be inappropriate."

        "abstract": [
            "The topography of the projections from the reticular nucleus of the thalamus (RT) to the intralaminar and medial thalamic nuclei were studied in the cat by the method of retrograde transport of horseradish peroxidase (HRP). Single small injections of the enzyme were made in the different intralaminar nuclei--mediodorsal, ventromedial, midline, and habenular--and in anterior group nuclei. The location and density of the neuronal labeling in the different parts of the RT were studied in each case. Our results show that 1) after injections located in all the nuclei here studied, a consistent number of labeled neurons were found in the RT, except for the injections in the lateral habenula and the anterior thalamic nuclear complex, both of which did not label neurons in the RT. 2) Among the other thalamic nuclei here studied, the most medially situated receive less numerous RT projections than those most laterally located. 3) Injections in all the nuclei studied gave rise to a cellular labeling in the anterior sectors of the RT, except for the anterior nuclear group and the lateral habenula. The projections from the rostral pole of the RT were topographically mediolaterally organized. 4) The anterodorsal part of the pregeniculate sector of the RT projects upon the large-celled part of the lateral central nucleus and to a lesser extent upon the paracentral, centromedian, and ventromedial nuclei, the anterior part of the lateral central nucleus, and the lateral band of the mediodorsal nucleus. The posterodorsal part of the RT pregeniculate sector only projects to the large-celled part of the lateral central nucleus. The dorsal portion of the posteroventral part of the RT pregeniculate sector also projects upon the large-celled part of the lateral central nucleus; its ventral portion projects to the ventromedial nucleus, the posterior part of the paracentral nucleus, the lateral band of the mediodorsal nucleus, and the centromedian nucleus. 5) The infrageniculate sector of the RT projects to the posterior part of the ventromedial nucleus. A weaker projection to the large-celled part of the lateral central nucleus, the centromedian nucleus, and the lateral band of the mediodorsal nucleus was also observed. 6) The ventral lateral geniculate nucleus projects upon the large-celled part of the lateral central nucleus, the lateral band of the mediodorsal nucleus, and the ventromedial nucleus. All these findings suggest an important modulatory action of the RT on the activity of the thalamic nuclei considered here."

        ], 
        "abstract": [
            "The cells of origin of the corticostriatal projection have been identified in squirrel monkeys by the use of the retrograde horseradish peroxidase method. In the subfields of the somatic sensory, motor, parietal and frontal areas of the cortex, cells projecting to the ipsilateral striatum are relatively sparsely distributed and form a group of small- to medium-sized pyramidal cells with an average somal diameter from area to area of 14-16 mum. Such cells are found only in layer V of the cortex (mainly in the more superficial parts of the layer). Since they are consistently smaller than the pyramidal cells of layer V that project to the brainstem and spinal cord and since they lie outside layer VI which gives rise to corticothalamic axons, the corticostriatal axons are unlikely to be collaterals of axons projecting to other sites. The cells of origin of the crossed corticostriatal projection are also found in layer V and are pyramidal cells with somal diameters in the same range as above. They are found only in areas 4, 8, and 6. Studies with the anterograde, autoradiographic method in rhesus, cynomologous and squirrel monkeys, indicate that the somatic sensory areas project to most of the antero-posterior extent of the ipsilateral putamen. Subareas 3a, 3b, 1 and 2 of the somatic sensory cortex project to the same region and the projection overlaps similarly extensive projections from the motor and certain other areas of the cortex. However, in each case the pattern of terminal labeling is in the form of interrupted clusters, strips and bands. A single small injection of the cortex is associated with only one or two such clusters of terminal labeling. This seems to imply that individual corticostriatal fibers end in a very restricted manner and that the terminal ramifications of fibers from one cortical area may alternate in the putamen with those arising in other areas."

        ], 
        "abstract": [
            "The subcortical projections of the centromedian (CM) and the parafascicular (Pf) thalamic nuclei were examined in the squirrel monkey (Saimiri sciureus) by using the lectin Phaseolus vulgaris-leucoagglutinin (PHA-L) as an anterograde tracer. Both CM and Pf project massively to the striatum where they arborize in a complementary fashion. On the one hand, CM innervates most of the putamen caudal to the anterior commissure, a dorsolateral rim of the putamen rostral to the anterior commissure, discrete areas of the head of the caudate nucleus close to the internal capsule, and a lateral sector of the body of the caudate nucleus. On the other hand, Pf provides a heavy input to the head, body, and tail of the caudate nucleus, and to the rostral putamen, excluding the areas innervated by CM. In addition, Pf projects more discretely to the nucleus accumbens and the olfactory tubercle. Therefore, the projections from both CM and Pf cover the entire striatum, with those from CM arborizing into the \"sensorimotor\" striatal territory and the ones from Pf innervating the \"associative-limbic\" striatal territory. Furthermore, CM and Pf project to extrastriatal subcortical structures, such as the globus pallidus, the subthalamic nucleus, and the substantia nigra, where they also terminate in a complementary fashion. Topographically and cytologically, Pf is closely related to the subparafascicular nucleus (sPf). The Pf-sPf complex projects to the hypothalamus, the substantia innominata, the peripeduncular nucleus, and the amygdala. It also gives rise to descending efferents arborizing in various brainstem structures, including the inferior olivary complex. Additional studies with retrograde double-labeling methods show that distinct cell groups within CM project to the motor cortex and the striatum. Likewise, separate neuronal populations within the CM-Pf-sPf complex give rise to striatal and brainstem projections, the former arising from CM and Pf and the latter mainly from sPf. The complementary nature of CM and Pf projections to the striatum and other basal ganglia components suggests that this thalamic complex participates in a highly ordered manner in the parallel processing of the information that flows through the basal ganglia."

            "The topographic distribution of medial pulvinar neuronal populations projecting to area 7a and to posterior cingulate gyrus (area 23) was investigated with retrograde axonal transport of fluorescent dyes. In an initial stage, separate injections of fast blue and diamidino-yellow were placed in area 7a. Two segregated backfilled cell populations were observed in the cingulate gyrus revealing a topographic distribution of cortico-cortical connections. In a second stage, the two dyes were injected in area 7a and in the posterior cingulate gyrus. After injections in two cortical sub-areas previously shown to be in topographic correspondence, the two projecting populations observed in the medial pulvinar overlapped extensively. In the case of injections in two regions not topographically correspondent, the two medial pulvinar populations were found to be segregated. These findings reveal that within both posterior parietal cortex and posterior cingulate gyrus, sub-areas which are in topographic correspondence receive projections from a common region of the medial pulvinar."

            "The sixth layer of the cerebral cortex has been studied by means of the Golgi method in Carnivora (dog and cat), Artiodactyla (cow and sheep), and Primates (human) brains; a basic structural uniformity being observed in all these species. Projection neurons of lamina VIa were large and medium sized pyramidal neurons (including atypical and multiapical), small pyramidal cells, and spinous multipolar neurons with long descending axons. Projection neurons of lamina VIb were medium sized pyramidal neurons and small pyramids, horizontal pyramids, inverted pyramidal cells, spinous multipolar neurons with long descending axons and large fusiform cells. Local circuit neurons of lamina VIa were Martinotti cells, basket neurons, neurogliaform cells, sparsely spinous neurons with whirled axons, spine-free multipolar cells and bipolar neurons. Local circuit neurons of lamina VIb were sparsely spinous and spine-free multipolar cells with short axons and bipolar neurons. Marked differences were observed between gyral, intermediate and fissural regions. Fusiform and bipolar neurons were vertically arranged in the former, but were tangentially orientated in intermediate and fissural regions; inverted pyramidal cells were present in the gyrus but horizontal pyramids were the respective cells in the intermediate and fissural zones. When compared with lissencephalic species, a great horizontal fibrillary system (which is vertically arranged in gyral regions) was observed in convoluted brains. Cells of origin were fusiform neurons, bipolar cells, horizontal and inverted pyramids and pyramidal neurons (the latter by means of horizontal axonal collaterals). The great development of this cortico-cortical association system in gyrencephalic species is considered to be a major step in neocortical evolution."

            "The projections from the claustrum to the cerebral cortex in the rat were examined by means of retrogradely transported fluorescent tracers Fast Blue (FB) and Diamidino Yellow dihydrochloride (DY), injected in the prefrontal, motor, somatosensory, auditory, and visual fields. In all cases, substantial numbers of retrogradely labeled neurons were observed in the ipsilateral and moderate to scant numbers in the contralateral claustrum insulare. Symmetrical bilateral injections of FB and DY as well as simultaneous injections of the tracers in the motor and visual cortex of the same hemisphere revealed no double-labeled neurons in the claustrum. The following conclusions may be drawn: The claustral projections to the motor, somatosensory, and visual cortex are prominent. The projection to the prefrontal cortex is less substantial and that to the auditory cortex is relatively modest. The claustrocortical connections lack the clear-cut topographic pattern of the thalamic nuclei but are, to some degree, preferentially arranged, albeit with considerable overlapping of the subpopulations of corticopetal neurons, a coarse anteroposterior topographic distribution appears to exist also in rodents. Neurons contributing to the claustrocortical connection project either ipsilaterally or contralaterally but not bilaterally. Projections to different cortical fields of one hemisphere also originate from separate claustral neurons."

            "The retrograde tracer cholera toxin B subunit (CTb) was used in combination with immunohistochemistry for tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), calbindin D-28k (CaBP), choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) and 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) to determine the distribution and relative proportion of brainstem chemospecific neurons that project to the pallidum in the squirrel monkey (Saimiri sciureus). Large injections of CTb involving both pallidal segments produce numerous retrogradely labeled neurons in the substantia nigra (SN), the pedunculopontine tegmental nucleus (PPN) and the dorsal raphe nucleus (DR). Labeled neurons are distributed uniformly in SN with a slight numerical increase at the junction between the pars compacta (SNc) and the ventral tegmental area (VTA). Retrogradely labeled neurons abound also in PPN, principally in its pars dissipata, whereas other CTb-labeled cells are scattered throughout the rostrocaudal extent of DR. After CTb injection involving specifically the internal pallidal segment (GPi), the same pattern of cell distribution is found in SN, PPN and DR, except that the number of retrogradely labeled cells is lower than after large pallidal complex injections. Approximately 70% of all CTb-labeled neurons in SNc-VTA complex display TH immunoreactivity, whereas 20% are immunoreactive for CaBP. About 39% of all retrogradely labeled neurons in PPN are immunoreactive for ChAT, whereas approximately 38% of the labeled neurons in DR display 5-HT immunoreactivity. Following CTb injection in the external pallidal segment (GPe), the number of labeled cells is much smaller than after GPi injection. The majority of CTb-labeled cells in SNc-VTA complex are located in the lateral half of SNc and approximately 93% of these neurons display TH immunoreactivity compared to 10% that are immunoreactive for CaBP; very few CTb-labeled cells occur in PPN. Retrogradely labeled cells in DR are located more laterally than those that projects to the GPi and about 25% of them are immunoreactive for 5-HT. These results suggest that, in addition to their action at striatal and/or nigral levels, the brainstem dopaminergic, cholinergic and serotoninergic neurons influence the output of the primate basal ganglia by acting directly upon GPi neurons."

        "abstract": [
            "Mesostriatal projections were labeled in 11 squirrel monkeys by injecting the anterograde tracer, [35S]methionine, into different parts of the dopamine-containing A8-A9-A10 cell complex of the midbrain. Two strikingly different compartmental patterns of mesostriatal projection were found. Fields of dense labeling in both the caudate nucleus and the putamen, interrupted by pockets of sparse labeling, were observed with deposits involving cell group A8, cell group A10 and/or the dorsally situated 'pars mixta' of the substantia nigra. Where striosomes could be identified as such in adjoining histochemically stained sections, the sparsely labeled zones were aligned with them. By contrast, a pattern of focally dense labeling in the caudate nucleus and putamen, with much weaker labeling surrounding the densely labeled zones, was found with injection sites centered in the horizontal band and associated ventrally extending fingers of the substantia nigra pars compacta. Many of the pockets of heightened labeling could be shown to correspond to histochemically defined striosomes. These compartmental patterns were identified both in the caudate nucleus and in the putamen. We conclude that the A8-A9-A10 cell complex of the primate contains spatially distinct subdivisions with preferential projections directed, respectively, toward the striosome and matrix compartments of the striatum."

        "abstract": [
            "Long projection axons from the Ch4 cell group of the nucleus basalis of Meynert (nbM) provide cholinergic innervation to the neurons of the cerebral cortex. This cortical cholinergic innervation has been implicated in behavioral and cognitive functions, including learning and memory. Recent evidence revealed differences among primate species in the pattern of cholinergic innervation specific to the prefrontal cortex. While macaques displayed denser cholinergic innervation in layers I and II relative to layers V and VI, in chimpanzees and humans, layers V and VI were as heavily innervated as the supragranular layers. Furthermore, clusters of cholinergic axons were observed within the prefrontal cortex of both humans and chimpanzees to the exclusion of macaque monkeys, and were most commonly seen in humans. The aim of the present study was to determine whether the Ch4 cell group was modified during evolution of anthropoid primates as a possible correlate of these changes in cortical cholinergic innervation. We used stereologic methods to estimate the total number of choline acetyltransferase-immunoreactive magnocellular neurons within the nbM of New World monkeys, Old World monkeys, apes, and humans. Linear regression analyses were used to examine the relationship of the Ch4 cell group with neocortical volume and brain mass. Results showed that total nbM neuron numbers hyposcale relative to both neocortical volume and brain mass. Notably, the total number of nbM neurons in humans were included within the 95% confidence intervals for the prediction generated from nonhuman data. In conclusion, while differences in the cholinergic system exist among primate species, such changes appear to involve mostly axon collateral terminations within the neocortex and, with the exception of the relatively small group of cholinergic cells of the subputaminal subdivision of the nbM at the anterointermediate and rostrolateral levels, are not accompanied by a significant extra-allometric increase in the overall number of subcortical neurons that provide that innervation."

Labeled fibers were present throughout the temporal pole and anterior aspects of the superior temporal, middle temporal, and inferior temporal gyri. ChAT-immunoreactive fibers were most dense in layer I to superficial layer III throughout anterior temporal cortex. In temporal pole, agranular and dysgranular regions had a greater density of labeled fibers in superficial layers as compared to granular regions. In addition to the superficial concentration of cholinergic fibers in lateral temporal regions, numerous labeled fibers were also present in deep cortical layers in the inferior temporal gyrus of lateral temporal cortex, with lesser concentrations of immunoreactive fibers present in these layers in superior and middle temporal gyri. These patterns of cholinergic innervation may reflect the degree of cholinergic modulation of functions in anterior temporal cortex."

            "The present study used injections of neuroanatomical tracers to determine the subcortical connections of the caudal and rostral subdivisions of the dorsolateral area (DL) and the middle temporal crescent area (MT(C)) in owl monkeys (Aotus trivirgatus), squirrel monkeys (Saimiri sciureus), and macaque monkeys (Macaca fascicularis and M. radiata). Emphasis was on connections with the pulvinar. Patterns of corticopulvinar connections were related to subdivisions of the inferior pulvinar (PI) defined by histochemical or immunocytochemical architecture. Connections of DL/MT(C) were with the PI subdivisions, PICM, PICL, and PIp; the lateral pulvinar (PL); and, more sparsely, the lateral portion of the medial pulvinar (PM). In squirrel monkeys, there was a tendency for caudal DL to have stronger connections with PICL than PICM and for rostral DL/MT(C) to have stronger connections with PICM than PICL. In all three primates, DL/MT(C) had reciprocal connections with the pulvinar and claustrum; received afferents from the locus coeruleus, dorsal raphe, nucleus annularis, central superior nucleus, pontine reticular formation, lateral geniculate nucleus, paracentral nucleus, central medial nucleus, lateral hypothalamus, basal nucleus of the amygdala, and basal nucleus of Meynert/substantia innominata; and sent efferents to the pons, superior colliculus, reticular nucleus, caudate, and putamen. Projections from DL/MT(C) to the nucleus of the optic tract were also observed in squirrel and owl monkeys. Similarities in the subcortical connections of the dorsolateral region, especially those with the pulvinar, provide further support for the conclusion that the DL regions are homologous in the three primate groups."

        "abstract": [
            "In the early 1970s, Andersen and colleagues proposed that the principal excitatory pathways of the hippocampal formation were organized in a lamellar fashion. This proposition, based heavily on the physiological studies of the proponents, indicated that \"a point source of entorhinal activity projects its impulses through the four membered pathway (of the hippocampal formation) along a slice or lamella, of hippocampal tissue oriented normally to the alvear surface\" [Anderson P., Bliss V.P. and Skrede K. K. (1971) Expl Brain Res. 13, 222-238] and perpendicular to the long axis of the hippocampus. Andersen et al. further suggested that, \"By means of this lamellar organization, small strips of the hippocampal cortex may operate as independent functional units, although excitatory and inhibitory transverse connections may modify the behavior of neighboring lamellae.\" The \"lamellar hypothesis\" of hippocampal anatomical organization has had tremendous influence on the conceptualization of hippocampal information processing and was largely responsible for prompting the establishment of the in vitro hippocampal slice technology. While the \"lamellar hypothesis\" was consistent with the known neuroanatomy, subsequent neuroanatomical investigations, using a variety of modern tracing techniques, have invariably demonstrated that all of the major hippocampal projections, except for those arising from the granule cells of the dentate gyrus, are much more divergent than would be consistent with a strict interpretation of the lamellar hypothesis. This has become particularly clear in ongoing studies of the intrinsic hippocampal projections using the recently introduced anterograde tracer, Phaseolus vulgaris leucoagglutinin. Citing the conclusions from several papers dealing with the anatomical organization of the hippocampal formation and using examples from recent Phaseolus vulgaris leucoagglutinin mapping studies, the following are demonstrated. (1) That the major hippocampal projections are as extensive and highly organized in the long or septotemporal axis of the hippocampus as in the transverse axis. (2) That at least some of the hippocampal projections, such as the associational projections arising from the dentate gyrus, appear to be specifically organized to integrate distant levels of the hippocampal formation. (3) That the physiological data of Anderson et al. can be re-interpreted in the light of these new anatomical data to show how the stimulation and recording protocols used at the time would, in fact, generate the appearance of a lamellar organization. It is concluded that it is heuristically most reasonable to consider the hippocampal formation as a three-dimensional cortical region with important information processing taking place in both the transverse and long axes.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"

            "The feedforward limb of the cerebrocerebellar system is directed largely through the corticopontine pathway. We determined the extent to which higher order corticopontine projections are derived from prefrontal associative cortices by injecting anterograde tracers into multiple prefrontal regions in rhesus monkeys. Most prefrontopontine projections were derived from the dorsolateral and dorsomedial convexities, including areas 8A, 46 dorsal, 9, and 10; and lighter projections arose from medial and ventrolateral cortices. These findings strengthen the observation that the cerebrocerebellar system incorporates associative cerebral regions, and they enhance the notion that the cerebellum participates in the organization of cognitive function."

        ], 
        "abstract": [
            "The efferent connections of the cerebral cortex to paramedial tegmental and basilar pons were studied in the monkey by using the retrograde and orthograde capabilities of the horseradish peroxidase (HRP) technique. Six capuchin monkeys (Cebus apella) received transcannular pontine HRP gel implants to retrogradely label the cells of origin of corticopontine projections. Four additional capuchin monkeys, one rhesus (Macaca mulatta), and one cynomolgus (Macaca fascicularis) monkey, received HRP gel implants in premotor (area 6), frontal eye field (FEF, area 8), superior (area 5), and inferior (area 7) parietal lobules to orthogradely label the course and termination of corticopontine projections, and thus to confirm the retrograde studies. The brains were processed according to the tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) protocol of Mesulam ('78) and studied with darkfield microscopy. Premotor (area 6) frontal cortex and FEF (area 8) were found to be the main sources of cortical inputs to the ipsilateral paramedian basilar pons, whereas FEF, dorsal prefrontal convexity, and dorsal medial prefrontal (granular frontal association) cortex were the main sources of bilateral projections to the paramedian pontine tegmentum. The medial portion of the nucleus reticularis tegmenti pontis (NRTP), considered to be a tegmental extension of the basilar pontine gray, also received its principal cortical input from the frontal lobe. Parietal cortex, on the other hand, was observed to project to lateral NRTP and lateral basilar pons. Although the possibility exists of convergence of frontal and parietal eye field efferents in the NRTP, the frontal eye field and prefrontal cortex appear to be the principal source of cortical projections to the paramedian pontine tegmentum, which contains the physiologically defined PPRF (paramedian pontine reticular formation), an important preoculomotor center. The results are discussed primarily with regard to their significance for potential cortical influence on the oculomotor system."

        ], 
        "abstract": [
            "Although substantia nigra dopaminergic neurons are spontaneously active both in vivo and in vitro, this activity does not depend on afferent input as these neurons express an endogenous calcium-dependent oscillatory mechanism sufficient to drive action potential generation. However, afferents to these neurons, a large proportion of them GABAergic and arising from other nuclei in the basal ganglia, play a crucial role in modulating the activity of dopaminergic neurons. In the absence of afferent activity or when in brain slices, dopaminergic neurons fire in a very regular, pacemaker-like mode. Phasic activity in GABAergic, glutamatergic, and cholinergic inputs modulates the pacemaker activity into two other modes. The most common is a random firing pattern in which interspike intervals assume a Poisson-like distribution, and a less common pattern, often in response to a conditioned stimulus or a reward in which the neurons fire bursts of 2-8 spikes time-locked to the stimulus. Typically in vivo, all three firing patterns are observed, intermixed, in single nigrostriatal neurons varying over time. Although the precise mechanism(s) underlying the burst are currently the focus of intensive study, it is obvious that bursting must be triggered by afferent inputs. Most of the afferents to substantia nigra pars compacta dopaminergic neurons comprise monosynaptic inputs from GABAergic projection neurons in the ipsilateral neostriatum, the globus pallidus, and the substantia nigra pars reticulata. A smaller fraction of the basal ganglia inputs, something less than 30%, are glutamatergic and arise principally from the ipsilateral subthalamic nucleus and pedunculopontine nucleus. The pedunculopontine nucleus also sends a cholinergic input to nigral dopaminergic neurons. The GABAergic pars reticulata projection neurons also receive inputs from all of these sources, in some cases relaying them disynaptically to the dopaminergic neurons, thereby playing a particularly significant role in setting and/or modulating the firing pattern of the nigrostriatal neurons."
